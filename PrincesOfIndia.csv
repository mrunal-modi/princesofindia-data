Born in a respectable family in Ajmer, Seth Hiralal, when a child of four years, came to Indore as an adopted son of Sir Hukamchand, the well-known business magnate of that place, and was educated under the fostering care of that shrewd businessman and industrialist. Seth Hiralal's arrival in the family of Sir Hukainchand is said to have been followed by an unbounded prosperity for Sir Hukamchand who also since got a male progeny in the now brilliant and promising youth, Kunwar Rajkumar Singh, M.A. Seth Hiralal was later on adopted by Sir Hukamchand's cousin-brother, Rai Bahadur Seth Kalyanmal, who had no progeny, and is now the sole successor of the late Rai Bahadur.

396,RAGHUBAR NARAYAN SINGH,"son of Rai Bahadur Dalip Narayan Singh, M.L.C., Monghyr, Behar, was born on the 16th of Assin, 1969 Sambat. He is a worthy son of an illustrious father. Rai Bahadur Dalip Narayan Singh is a prominent social worker of Behar. He has donated large sums of money to charitable purposes. His earnest zeal for the uplift of women in general and Hindu widows in particular is well known. His Bailey Dharamsala, Lady Stephenson Zenana Hospital and an ashram for Hindu widows are the best examples of his charitable work. Babu Raghubar Narayan Singh has not only inherited all that is good in his father but gives every promise of even excelling him in the noble qualities of head and heart. In his present tender age of 24 years he has exhibited such talents that in future years the Province may reasonably expect to have in him a fine piece of humanity. He has creditably passed the Senior Cambridge Examination from the St. Paul's at Darjeeling and has attained remarkable knowledge of literature by dint of hard studies at home. He is the head of the Hindi Literary Society of the Monghyr District and by his unmitigated zeal helped to make the first District Conference of the Hindi Literary Society a grand success. He has of late begun to devote himself to writing of 69 books and articles in Hindi and the first book of his named Kartarya or Adarsh Hindu Jiwan is in press at present. Within a short period he has succeeded in making a big and fine collection of books on almost all subjects including some rare books and manuscripts. He intends opening in the near future a large public library which may prove the only one of its kind in the Province. In phy- sical culture too he stands quite apart from the young aristocracy of the age. Here we find a well-exercised body, strong muscles and a majestic gait. He is a keen lover of sports too and is of very active habits. He has graduated from Professor M. V. Krishna Rao's School of Physical Culture at Ootaca- mund. In qualities of heart, largely inherited from his mother whom he was unfortunate to lose in the terrible earth- quake of 1934, there remains nothing to be desired. His activities in giving relief to the flood-stricken people of the Monghyr District after the earthquake, with the help of hundreds of young student volunteers at his command, con- stituted the only example of its kind in Monghyr aristocracy. He helped a great deal in the distribution of Government relief to the earthquake sufferers and took particular care that they did not go to the undeserving. He is one of the Vice- Chairmen and Vice-Patrons of the Mon- ghyr District Sports Association, of which the District Magistrate is the President and the Superintendent of Police is the General Secretary the Raghubar Narain Singh, Monghyr. General Secretary of the District Students' Association of Monghyr; the President of Basdeopur M. E.

608,THE LATE JALBHAI DORABJI BHARDA,"B.A., a great Educationist and Joint Principal and founder of the biggest High School in Bombay, viz., the Bharda New High School, was born at Udwada on 16th February, 1864.

He opened the New High School in collaboration with another great Educationist, the late Mr. Kaikobad Behramji Murzban, in 1891, which school in the very first year of its existence had 901 pupils on its rolls. The school became extremely popular in Bombay and its popularity and prosperity increased by leaps and bounds. In 1900 the number on the rolls was 1,419; in 1901 it rose to 2,008; in 1915 to 2,271 even to-day the school can boast of a larger number of pupils than in any other school in the whole Presidency. The school has always worked in a spirit of genuine loyalty to Government. The school had the good fortune of celebrating its Silver Jubilee in 1915. Some of the old boys of the school are to-day holding high and enviable positions such as Ministers, Judges, Lawyers, Council- lors, Baronets, Knights and important businessmen. Mr. Bharda had a great ambition to go to Europe to study the methods of teaching, and he carried this out in 1903. Before going to Europe he had made a thorough study of the German and French languages to enable him to follow the teaching courses of the German and French schools and studied in different schools in Europe like an ordinary student and made a thorough and intensive study of the different problems concerning the progress of a modern school. On his return to India he introduced and carried out the latest methods, The late Jalbhai Dorabji Bharda, B.A., Bombay. that he had learnt there, in his own beloved institution.

He was a man of a high moral character and the diligence and intelligence that he possessed was out of the ordinary. He could solve a knotty problem, even as a boy, without any help or difficulty. He had a great passion for the study of Astronomy and this love of Astronomy remained with him till his death. He was a versatile scholar and could teach in all the classes of his school on each and every subject at a moment's notice. He possessed a large library, containing some of the rarest books, particularly on subjects dealing with Astronomy, Mathematics and Chemistry. He himself wrote several works on these subjects. He had a passionate love for poetry and his most favourite poet was Tennyson, and the In Memoriam' of the latter had a great fascination for him and he was often heard reciting it to himself. He was made a Fellow of the Bombay University in 1912, which position he retained till his death. He took keen interest in improving the system of University examinations, and was Chairman of the first Joint Examination Board. Over and above his own institution, he gave his valued help and advice to several other educational institutions. He was a modest and an unassuming gentleman, and was of retiring and simple habits. He was, together with his colleague, the late Mr. Murzban, an idol of his pupils. He died on the 12th July, 1921, deeply mourned by his pupils, old and new, and by numerous admirers all over the Presidency.",BOMBAY & SIND.

Mr. Bhatt had the misfortune of losing his father when he was only 7 very years young age to shoulder his own responsibility and face the world. He began his career by joining of age. He had to depend for his early education on his relations, and prepare himself at a the ""Bombay Samachar"" on a salary of Rs. 15 per month. By dint of hard work, honesty of purpose and the strength of character late Mr. Ramchandra M. Bhatt steadily rose in life, and soon afterwards turned his attention to business, for which he was really cut out by temperament and instinct. He first made his mark as a prominent businessman and a contractor when the last World War broke out. His business activities were not merely confined to one industry. He was at one time a Railway contractor, promoter of an Insurance Company, besides being one of the pioneers of the film industry in India. He was also connected with iron trade and Mill Industry. In spite of these multifarious activities as a busi- nessman Mr. Bhatt always found time for doing social and public work not only in Bombay Presidency but also in his native place. A prominent figure in public life of Bombay, the late Mr. Bhatt was known and admired for his philanthropy. As a self- made man in his days of affluence, he was ever ready to help in any deserving cause. He, in his many-sided charities, never forgot his village and his country, which owe to him a deep gratitude, and there are several institutions which stand to-day as monuments Late Mr. Ramchandra Madhavram Bhatt, of his charitable disposition. C.B.E., J.P., Bombay. Mr. Bhatt's name appeared in every appeal for public funds. He took a special interest in relief of suffering humanity and in the spread of education for which he gave away large sums of money without ostentation or advertisement. His charities have been of a catholic nature without discrimination of caste and creed. The following are his principal benefactions :- Rs. 55,000 for scholarships from proceeds of buildings for which a trust was created. Rs. 50,000 in establishing a charitable dispensary at Mota (Bardoli) with suitable build- ing to house the same (1914). Rs. 25,000 for an Anglo-Vernacular School at Mota (Bardoli).

Rs. 25,000 for the Art Gallery in Bombay. Over and above these princely donations amounting to over two lacs of rupees Mr. Bhatt gave away several lacs of rupees during the last quarter of a century in private charities. The last 15 years of his life were devoted more to social and public duties than to his business activities, his business mainly attended by his gifted son, Mr. Prabhashanker. He did very valuable but silent work as an elected Member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation, 1923, till death and also as a member of the Standing Committee of the Bombay Improvement Trust Committee of the Bombay Municipal Corporation.

Was for some time a Professor of Law at the Govern- ment Law School at Bombay. Twice acted as Judge of the Court of Small Causes, Bombay. His patience, fair-mindedness and anxiety to do full justice to each case before him marked him out as one of the best Judges of the Court. Though his permanent appointment as Judge of this Court would have proved a tower of strength to the Bench, Mr. Bilimoria preferred to practise as a Barrister in the High Court and soon became one of its leading practitioners. At present Mr. Bilimoria is Official Assignee of Bombay, in which capacity he has already given great satis- faction to the profession and the public at large.

615,KHAN BAHADUR SIR DOSSABHOY HORMUSJI BHIWANDIWALLA,"J.P., Honorary Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, and a prominent Abkari, Salt, and Opium Contractor, is the son of the late Khan Bahadur Hormusji Bhiwandiwalla, J.P. After completing scholastic education Sir Dossabhoy was called upon at a very early age to face the hereulean task of managing the vast business and commercial activities of his father, who died leaving Sir Dossabhoy just in his teens. It was generally believed that at the death of the late Khan Bahadur Hormusji the entire business would come to a stand- still, as the boy was too young to be expected to shoulder the heavy responsibilities incidental to the conducting of a business on a colossal scale. But under the able guidance and tender care of his mother, a lady of commanding intellect and broad sympathies, Sir Dossabhoy carried on the business steadfastly and with an unbend- ing iron determination, and it must be said to his great credit that within a short time he handled the situation with the dexterity of a sound and inborn businessman. The keynote of his success was his love for work, and hard work too. He attended and still attends to his duties regularly seven days in a week from the early hours of the morning, and to-day there is hardly any important commercial line in which Sir Dossabhoy is not interested, either as a financier, director or partner. Though Sir Dossabhoy has amassed a vast fortune, he has never resorted to speculative and 'get-rich-quick"" policy. His business acumen, shrewd calculative instinct and solid hard work have contributed to his success as a busi- Khan Bahadur Sir Dossabhoy Hormusji ness man. To-day Sir Dossabhoy Bhiwandiwalla, J.P., Honorary Presidency is the biggest Salt, Abkari and Opium Magistrate, Bombay. Contractor, bringing in lacs of rupees to Government and the Indian States. As a result of his vast business activities there are thousands of labourers under his employ, earning their livelihood under a kind and generous master. He takes a literally fatherly care of these poor toilers. Their health, comfort and general welfare are always his first consideration and he is literally adored by them. The most significant and noteworthy trait that one finds in Sir Dossabhoy's character and career is his inherent hatred for cheap publicity and popularity. He avoids limelight and hates making fuss and much ado about nothing. He is very simple in his tastes and habits, and in spite of his millions he is very simply attired. The poorest of the poor finds an easy and ready access to his office, and no deserving person leaves his doors without receiving Khan Bahadur Hormusji Bhiwandiwalla. financial assistance or sound advice. Like his father he dedicates J.P., Bombay. a certain part of his earnings to the service of others, and his charities, which run into lacs, are of a cosmopolitan nature. Sir Dossabhoy is also an ardent enthusiast of all kinds of sports, particularly riding, swimming, shikar and cruising, and in aviation he has evinced a very keen interest. His lovely motor boat, ""Hormazd,"" and his private aeroplanes have afforded his numerous friends enough of innocent recreation and pleasure. Besides, he takes a keen interest in gardening and in collect- ing and maintaining a good variety of birds and animals, of which there fs a regular menagerie in his big estate at Uran. He represents in his person a rare combination of affluence and simplicity, tireless industry and the saving grace of human culture in some of its tenderest aspects. The strongest feature of Sir Dossabhoy's character is his prudence. Although his heart is always warm in its affections and he is over-liberal in his contributions to all deserving charities and public-utility projects, at the same time he is unyielding in regard to all visionary projects and wild-goose chase, and all unworthy calls on his charity. He shrewdly calculates every man's value and gives him a solid esteem proportionate to it. Sir Dossabhoy is held in the highest esteem by all classes of people, irrespective of caste and creed, for his high character, commanding intellect, broad sympathies, extensive charities, polished manners, simple habits, and respect and consideration for those less fortunate in the struggles of life. As Honorary Presidency Magistrate he enjoys a wide reputation for scrupulous honesty and strict impartiality.",BOMBAY & SIND.

He has done a great deal to relieve suffering and dis- tress unostentatiously and privately, though he has contributed publicly large sums of money towards medical institutions, schools and gymkhanas, for the benefit of his own community in India.

In his younger days Sir Dhunjibhoy was a true physical culturist and a pupil and friend of the late Eugene Sandow, the pioneer of physical culture, who, a quarter of a century ago, was called to Bombay to give him special physical treatment.

666,AL-HAJ QASSIMALLY JAIRAZBHOY,"Justice of the Peace, Honorary Presidency Magistrate, Landlord, a profound religious thinker and author of several religious treatises, Bombay. Was born on the 28th October, 1886. Few families have played a more important part in the commercial and industrial development of the Capital and Western India than the illustrious and ancient family of the late Mr. Jairazbhoy Peerbhoy, J.P., who was personally held in great veneration throughout Asia, China and Africa as a distinguished pioneer of commerce and a citizen of examplary honesty and industry. He is remembered to this date by every devout Mohammadan, not only for his phenomenal commercial success, but also for his large-hearted benevolence and vast charities. He spent a large amount of his fortune in promoting education, reliev- ing the poor and destitute, comforting the sick, erect- ing sanitorium, rest-houses and schools and generally in endeavouring to ameliorate the condition of the less-favoured members of the community. These charities and his public spirit constitute his chief claim to be classed among the representative men of the city. As a prominent advocate of reform in the The late Mr. Jairazbhoy Muslim community or as a member of the Munici- Mrs. Rematbai Jairazbhoy, wife Peerbhoy, pal Corporation, or as an active member of the Port of late Mr. Jairazbhoy Peerbhoy. Trust to which he was nominated by Government in recognition of his great commercial knowledge and experience, he proved himself an invaluable citizen. He had acquired a large fortune by his diligence and perseverance, and, what is more, he knew how to spend much of it for the welfare and advancement of his community. By his death Bombay lost an esteemed citizen and his own community a distin- guished leader and a noble benefactor. Mr. Jairazbhoy left two sons-Mr. Noor Mohammad and Mr. Qassimally. The former, who was also a very illustrious young man of great promise, died at an early age of 31 and it fell to the lot of Mr. Qassimally to uphold the dignity and good name of his family. The traditions of this distinguished family are worthily maintained by Al-Haj Qassimally who, with the co-operation and advice of his gifted mother, Mrs. Rematbai Jairazbhoy, a lady of singular ability and attractive launching and executing several benevolent schemes. disposition, has been responsible for successfully Like his father Al-Haj Qassimally is a firm believer in the principle that if the lot of the illiterate and ignorant section of the Mohammadans is to be im- proved the best effort should be in the direction of Al-Haj Qassimally Jairazbhoy, Justice of the Peace, Bombay. education. He gave a princely sum of Rs. 1,25,000 for establishing a chair in the Muslim University in the name of his revered father. He has also made generous contributions to the Mohammadan Girls' Orphanage and to the Victoria Memorial School for the Blind, etc. complete record in this sketch. Suffice it to say that no deserving cause has been laid before a Al-Haj Qassimally's private charities have been extensive and it is impossible to give him in vain and no subscription list is brought to him without securing his support. Nor have his gifts been confined to his own people or to those who profess his creed. As a staunch and devout disciple of the Great Prophet of Islam, he has always been catholic in his public and private charities. His feelings of compassion even for dumb animals and thirsty wayfarers have found expression in the building of a beautiful fountain at the junction of Hornby and Paltan Roads in Bombay at an expense of Rs. 25,000. It was built in the sacred memories of his late father and 145 his brother, Noor Mohammad, and was declared open on 17th November, 1911, by Lady Clarke (wife of the then Governor of Bombay). Amongst other notable public subscriptions of Mr. Qassimally are : Rs. 20,000 during the Balkan War to help the orphans and widows of Turkish soldiers who had fallen in the War; Rs. 5,000 to the Royal Visit Fund, 1911; Rs. 1,000 for flood relief in Hyderabad and the Deccan and Rs. 5,000 to the Red Crescent Society Funds during the Turko-Italian War in Tripoli. During the famine of 1911 he opened a grain shop on a large scale in his native country. He has also contributed liberally to the Ahmedabad Moham- madan Orphanage, Hyderabad Flood Relief Fund, Sir Syed Ahmed Memorial Fund, Mrs. Millard's School for the Blind, Edward's Orphanage for Mohammadan Girls, Broach Mohammadan Educa- tional Fund, Ismaili Religious Library, Islam Gymkhana, Islam Club, Bombay Medical Congress, Khandesh Mohammadan Educational Fund and South-African Indian Relief Fund. Besides, there are a number of small educational institutions to which he has given hundreds of rupees regularly. During the World War Al-Haj gave his valuable car to the Ambulance Brigade, and his example was followed by others. He also did valuable propaganda work. He is eminently a man of deeds and not words. And whatever he does he does in an unobtrusive and silent manner. Al-Haj Qassimally's motto is ""Duty before pleasure."" He is naturally held in the highest esteem by all classes of people, irrespective of race and creed. He is no less renowned for his deep and abiding loyalty to the British Throne than for his benevolence and patriotism. Mr. Qassimally was created a Justice of the Peace in 1911, when this honour was very sparingly bestowed. He was also appointed an Honorary Presidency Magistrate. He was elected to the Bombay Municipal Corporation in 1914. He had further been appointed the President of the Khoja Punjebhai Club by His Highness the Aga Khan. He was a prominent member of the Muslim League, and was first Vice-President of the Bombay Presidency Branch of the League. He is one of the staunchest and most energetic disciples of the Great Prophet Mohammad in the spreading and popularising of whose religious precepts and doings he has spared neither money, nor trouble, nor energy. He has written several important religious treatises, some of which are (1) Comparative Greatness of Quran, (2) Islamic Prayers, (3) How to Perform Haj, (4) Fear Allah and Take Your Own Part. The last-mentioned work contains eight illustrations including one showing that Bonaparte was a Mohammadan. In his last book entitled Mohammad A Mercy to All the Nations,"" which is being printed in England by Messrs. Unwin Bros., Ltd., Al-Haj has specially stressed the point that the advent of Prophet Mohammad was prophesied in Scriptures of World Religions, such as the Bible, Bhavishya Puran, and Zend Avasta. Mr. Qassimally performed the Haj in 1932, which is the fifth duty of Islam. Hence he is described as Al-Haj. In 1933 Al-Haj Qassimally went on a tour round the world in company of his wife. In Williams- burg, Toranto and Canada Al-Haj Qassimally distri- buted literature on Islam published by him. In America he interviewed some of the leading citizens interested in his faith. The ""Toranto Daily Star"" and the 'Williamsburg Times"" were loud in the praises of the good work Al-Haj was doing in the cause of Islam. Mr. and Mrs. Qassimally also visited the Chicago World's Fair and there too his work, enthusiasm and zeal for Islam were very loudly praised. In Japan he energetically propogated Islamic culture and religion and increased the number of the followers of the Prophet. He also gave a handsome donation towards the building of a mosque in Japan. In China and Colombo on his way back his one thought was always Islam and what he could do to support this Faith. Al-Haj Qassimally is one of the very few Mus- lims in his position and status of life who has worked single-handed and in a quiet way, yet SO effectively, to spread the religion of the Prophet. Al-Haj Mrs. Khoorshid Qassimally Jairazbhoy, J.P., Bombay, was born in 1903 and received educa- tion in Rangoon. She married Al-Haj Qassimally Al-Haj Mrs. Khoorshid Qassimally Jairazbhoy, J.P., Bombay, Jairazbhoy, J.P., on the 4th May, 1919, at Bombay 146 amidst great eclat. She is one of the leading Society ladies, taking a very keen interest in welfare and charitable work. As a Member of the Women's Council and of the Advising Committee of Cama Hospital she has rendered useful services. She is also a prominent figure in all the activities connected with the Princess Victoria Mary Gymkhana. Though a very intellectually gifted lady, Mrs. Qassimally is against making a show of her abilities. She is an ardent helpmate to her noble and philanthropic husband. She takes particular interest in female education amongst Muslims, besides taking a leading part in the welfare movements of her sex. She possesses winning manners and is a charming hostess. Mrs. Qassimally performed the Haj in company of her husband in 1932 and to her goes the credit of taking films of the Haj ceremony in three reels and the different scenes of Mecca and Medina with quotations from the Holy Quran inscribed. During her world tour with her husband in 1933 these films were shown by her at different places in Europe and America and were greatly admired and appreciated. In recog- nition of her social and charitable work Government was pleased to appoint her a Justice of the Peace for the Town and Island of Bombay, an honour which a very few ladies of her community enjoy.",BOMBAY & SIND.

No doubt she has rendered signal services during the Scientific Exhibition and as a member of the Committee of Silver Jubilee she gave Rs, 5,000 as a donation for the distri- bution of the Silver Jubilee Medals to the children of the Municipal Schools.

She paid Rs. 250, thereby becoming the Patron of the Seals of the Appeal Fund. Her unceasing interest in social and charitable work is further manifested in her recent contributions of Rs. 1,251 for the Viceroy's Live-Stock Improve- ment Scheme in the Bombay Suburban District through the Deputy Collector, Khan Bahadur Sheikh Mohiyuddin, and Rs. 380 for a stud bull for the same purpose. She gave Rs. 501 to the Bombay Mayor's Famine Relief Fund through Sir Jahangir Boman Behram to be utilized for feeding cattle in the famine-stricken areas of the Presidency. She is an active member of the W. I. A. A. and for five successive months she carried away the prizes for enlisting every month the greatest number of new members, thus proving a great friend to motorists. 149 Once again she actively helped Mrs. Blackwell in collecting funds for the British ex- Servicemen, being on the Committee of Poppy Day Organisation. She paid Rs. 300 for programme of the Poppy Day Dance autographed by H. E. the Governor and Lady Brabourne. On her return from the world tour she received a very warm welcome at the Pier from quite a host of friends led by Mrs. Blackwell to whom she has given invaluable help in the various charitable enterprises that perpetually engage that good lady's time and energy. She has had a marvellous time everywhere, collecting a wealth of impressions in the many lands and countries she has visited.

717,THE HON. SIR HORMUSJI MANECKJI MEHTA,"KT., was born of poor parents on the 1st day of April, 1871. He finished his English education at the Elphinstone High School, after which he was compelled by circumstances to earn his livelihood as a clerk in a local firm. He then joined as an Accountant in His Majesty's Mint in Bombay in the year 1890, but his youthful energy sought an opening in a higher work as a salesman in which capacity he worked in several firms. In 1894 he joined the firm of Messrs. D.R. Umrigar & Co., as chief salesman of mill stores and plant of every description, and in 1896 formed a limited company under the name and style of the Mill Stores Trading Co. of India Ltd., which he still controls. For furthering the interests of this new company he visited Europe several times, worked in several Lancashire factories and secured their agencies for India. He has acquired by this time thorough practical experience of mill machinery and stores which has been of utmost value in later years. Being very successful in business, Sir Hormusji purchased, in partnership with the late Sheth Mangaldas Girdhardas Parekh, the Mill Magnate of Ahmedabad, the Victoria Mills Ltd. in the year 1904 and made it a limited concern. Later on the two partners purchased the Jubilee Mills and the Raja Gokuldas Mills, which were similarly converted into limited companies. Business thrived very rapidly. With courage and zeal several new concerns were floated such as the British India General Insurance Company, Ltd.; the Zenith Life Assurance Co., Ltd.; the Poona Electric Supply Co., Ltd.; the Northern India Portland Cement Co., Ltd.; T.R. Pratt (Bombay) Ltd.; M. T. Ltd.; the New Electric Totalizater Co. Ltd.; H. M. Mehta & Co. (Cotton Department), Cromptons (Bombay), Ltd.; etc. etc. At the end of the Great War there was heavy The Hon.

Sir Hormusji had to exert himself much to keep aright the several concerns he had floated and with his usual tact and zeal he passed through this period very successfully. In 1928 a cotton mill at Billimora was purchased along with his lifelong partner and friend, late Sheth Mangaldas Girdhardas Parekh, and made into a limited concern. The mill is at present doing very good business in spite of trade depression. In 1929 the Nasik-Deolali Electric Supply Co. Ltd. and in 1931 the Nadiad Electric Supply Co. Ltd. were floated. In 1930 Sir Hormusji appeared in the public to contest in the bye-election in the Bombay Non-Mohammadan Constituency for a seat in the Council of State, vacated by Mr. Ratansey Morarji. In the contest Sir Hormusji was declared duly elected. In the year following, in a general election he was again successfully elected from the same constituency to the Council of State. In 1932 Sir Homi Mehta was appointed on the Behar and Orissa Committee by the Government of India to set the boundaries of the new Orissa Province in accordance with the natural and cultural unity of the Orieans. Sir Hormusji has at present a very expert knowledge of the mill stores and machinery and was several times consulted as such. He has besides a good knowledge of electric concerns as also the insurance business. throughout his career he has been very tactful and energetic. His charities are also great but not made known.

723,MRS. J. K. MEHTA,"a well-known philanthropist of Bombay, daughter of Framji Petit, M son Her mother was a daughter of Sir Dinshaw's brother, Nusserwanjee. Inherit- of Sir Dinshaw, the first Bronet, and sister of the late Sir Dinshaw Petit, the second ing Baronet. the vast fortunes of the millionaire brothers, she has also inherited the spirit of benevolence and administrative talents of both. The Petit family is renowned all over Iadia for the splendid pioneering work done by the founders of the house, Manakji Nasarwanji Petit, in promoting the cotton spinning, weaving and dyeing industry in the country, and, still more, for the useful and charitable institutions founded and supported by the illustrious members of the family. His sons, Dinshaw and Nasarwanji, distinguished themselves still more by their achievements in the development of commercial enterprise in the Bombay Presidency, and each en- hanced the family's reputation for philanthropy by many deeds of benevolence. Dinshaw Petit was regarded during his lifetime as the richest Parsi, nay, the richest. Indian citizen of Bombay. In recognition of his commercial and industrial enterprise and muni- ficence, Queen Victoria conferred on him the honour of Knighthood and subsequently raised him to the dignity of a Baronet. Mrs. Mehta, the subject of this sketch, showed, whilst yet a child, great keenness for horse-riding, and soon came to be known as a very keen sportswoman. She owned race-horses and carried away many a prize in hunting and cross-country riding. In 1919 she married Mr. Jehangir K. B. Mehta, a nephew of the late Sir Pherozeshah M. Mehta, the great Parsi politician. Mrs. Mehta has found in her husband a Mrs. . K. Mehta, Bombay. cordial co-adjutor in her philanthropic activities as well as a constant companion in the field of sport. He, too, is very fond of riding and is well known in the sporting circles of Bombay. Greatly interested in social welfare work, he takes an active interest in the work of all endowments created by the Petit family, of which he is a trustee. On the death of her mother, Mrs. Mehta inherit- ed a very large sum of money and very valuable jewel- lery. The jewellery, estimated at twelve hundred thousand rupees, she donated towards an orphanage for Parsi girls. There was then in Bombay an orphanage for Parsi boys founded in commemoration of Nasarwanjee Petit's son, Jamshedji, but none for orphan girls. Thanks to Mrs. Mehta's munificence, this crying need of the community has been satisfied. Associating the institution with the name of her mother, she called it the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Parsi Girls' Orphanage. Besides giving away her jewellery for the orphanage, she has dedicated herself to the institution, which is to-day admittedly a model institution of its kind in India. Numerous indigent and infirm people requiring pecuniary or other relief, hundreds of poor students needing financial assistance and various institutions engaged in welfare work languishing for lack of funds, have found in Mrs. Mehta a ready helper.

Sometime ago a leading Parsi reformer had foundation-stone of this Agiari. Other Indian communities have also had a large share of her bounty. Her catholic than charities, made without distinction of caste and creed, have been computed at not less her for a million rupees. Up to the present something like five million rupees have been given by charitable purposes. Mrs. Mehta, who is still young, is engrossed with ideas and enthusiasm for the promotion of human happiness. It may be expected, therefore, that in years to come she will, by her thought- still ful endowments, lay the public of Bombay, and the Parsi community in particular, under a deeper debt of gratitude.

After completing his education he took to commerce, his late father also having been a well-known businessman. He has, by his tactful manners, zealous industry, business acumen, great integrity and sound commercial knowledge, attained high distinction in the business and commer- cial world. In 1934-35 he was elevated to the respon- sible and high office of the President of the Mudhol Durbar Subjects' Representative Assembly, which position he held with singular distinction and selfless devotion. He takes a keen interest in all movements connected with the welfare and uplift of the poor and indigent. His manifold philanthropic charities in the cause of the oppressed humanity have endeared him to the public and won for him the admiration of the rich and the poor alike. He took a leading part in raising large sums of money for War Loans and he has always been in the forefront of all Government and loyal activities. He was selected as President of the Royal Silver Jubilee Committee in the Mudhol State and he paid a handsome contribution to the Silver Jubilee Fund. It is important to note that, in the absence of His Highness of Mudhol from the State, Nagarshet Chuni- lal was especially deputed by His Highness to per- form the ceremony of presenting Silver Jubilee Medals to its recipients at a special Durbar held in the Nagarshet Chunilal Kasturchand Oshwal, Banker, Mudhol State. State Palace. It is believed that this was the only instance in the history of all the States that a State subject was deputed to carry out this most important duty. The Durbar for this purpose was held on the 6th May, 1935. The extent to which he has been enjoying the confidence of the Mudhol Durbar for the last many years will be evident from the fact that the Durbar was graciously pleased to confer on him, on the 10th of June, 1936, the distinction and title of Nagarshet. The presentation of this title was made amidst great pomp and rejoicing. The ceremony was performed at a Special Durbar held on the 10th June, 1936, which was the birthday of His Highness the Raja Sahib. It was a special and unique Durbar, without parallel in the annals of State functions, and, befittingly with the occasion, it was preceded by a great procession throughout the important streets and localities of Mudhol. Sheth Chunilal was carried in the State car amidst great pomp. For the last 60 years there was no Nagarshet appointed by the State. In view of all the above facts, the appointment of Shet Chunilal to this position is in every sense unique and historical. In commemoration of this event, Nagarshet Chunilal gave a handsome donation for opening a Maternity Home in the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital at Mudhol. Nagarshet Chunilal is a promising youth and has, it is evident, a great future before him. He is held in the highest esteem by all classes of people for his high character and genial temperament, princely munificence and innate nobility of soul. 178",BOMBAY & SIND.

751,THE LATE KHAN BAHADUR BURJORJI DORABJI PATEL,"C.I.E., O.B.E., a Mer- chant Prince of Baluchistan, a great philanthropist, a business magnate, and an illus- trious son of the Parsi community, was born on the 29th September, 1858, of poor parents in the obscure village of Kundiana in the Bombay Presidency. He was a self- made man in the strictest sense of the term, having won for himself the gifts of the world and honours from Government, as well as position and popularity not only in his own community, but also in the country. As far back as 1878 he established himself as a merchant in Quetta and, by dint of foresight, ability and industry, soon be- came a leading and honoured businessman in Baluchistan, and at the time of his death he was reckoned a leader among merchants having dealings with Military, Railway and other departments in Balu- chistan. Khan Bahadur Patel was the Founder and Proprietor of the St. John Mill at Quetta, the premises forming a compre- hensive manufacturing centre, as the works comprised Roller, Flour Mills, Ice Factory, Saw and Mortar Mills, and a Patent Fuel Factory. He also owned extensive coal and chromite mines at Much and Hindu- bagh. Besides these, he owned flour mills, rice mills, oil mills and hydraulic wool and cotton presses at Jacobabad and vast property at Karachi, Quetta and Bombay. During the Great War these works were of the greatest assistance to the Imperial Government, as fittingly acknow- ledged by the Assistant Director of Sup- plies, 4th Quetta Division. When it is borne in mind that these numerous enterprises were initiated at a The late K. B. Burjorji Dorabji Patel, C.I.E., O.B.E. time when civilization and progress were but little understood in Baluchistan, when industrialism had not called skilled labourers into being, and when the means of transport of all classes of goods were wholly inadequate, one can wonder at the master mind that started them and controlled them SO successfully till the end of his life. The late Khan Bahadur was the first Parsi to have earned the dignified privileges of having been appointed an Honorary Magistrate and a Member of the Municipal Committee in Quetta. He was the first non-official Member and Vice-President of the Cantonment Board for three years and his services in this direction were highly appreciated and recorded in glowing terms by Major-General F. W. Ramsay, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O. As an Honorary Magistrate of the First Class he rendered very valuable services. He was also a leading and generous member of the Masonic Fraternity. It was quite a happy and inspiring sight to see daily this master of millions, and owner of cars and carriages, bicycling or walking quite leisurely all the way from his residence to the Court and back. In spite of his wealth and enviable position, Khan Bahadur Patel was always courteous, unostentatious and unassuming, the child-like modesty of his nature ever vibrating to the needs and wants of his fellow-beings. with which Khan Bahadur Patel's name is not associated and which has not shared substantially in There is not a work of public utility, or charitable institution of any kind in Quetta, his liberality."" In these words the late Major-General Sir James Brown, A.G.G. of Baluchistan, referred to Mr. Patel's various charities. He contributed liberally to the Church of England and likewise to all other religious objects, to the support of temples, orphanages, schools, maternity, 180 leprosy and other hospitals, to funds in aid of wars, relief in time of plague, famine other or disaster, places. not only in Baluchistan, the Punjab, Sind and Gujarat, but also in Italy, Japan and estimate the He was one of the founders of the Pasteur Institute of Kasauli. It is impossible to of total amount of his charities, but it can safely be said that he gave away about ten lacs community rupees in different charities. Though he had worked unceasingly for the welfare of his own of which he esteemed and affectionate leader till the end of his life and for the betterment to of which he was contributed an SO very liberally, he never allowed consideration of caste or creed interfere with the exercise of his true and cosmopolitan charity. The town of Quetta owes to the late Khan Bahadur not a little. He was and the apprecia- father and the founder of the Quetta Electric Supply Co., Ltd. He gained the confidence gifts to all tion of the whole population of Quetta, civil and military, by his large-hearted his rosity may be mentioned the Victoria Memorial Soldiers' Home, the Solator Patel deserving causes.

Khan Bahadur Patel died on the 18th May, 1931, and the news of his death was received with great shock and sincere sorrow both by the Government and the public. As soon as the news was conveyed to the Honourable the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner The in Baluchistan orders for closing all the Government offices and institutions were issued. love and esteem with which Quetta regarded her benefactor was amply manifest on the occasion of his funeral. It was admitted by one of the oldest residents that it was the largest funeral procession ever witnessed on the station. Among the distinguished civil and military officers, chiefs and citizens present were Major-General Newcome, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., in charge, Western Command, Nawab Sir Mir Shame Shah, K.C.I.E., representing the Kalat State, Sir Henry Holland, the Chief of Baluchistan Police, and others. Besides, several other local public institutions of all nationalities convened special emergency meetings to give expression to their deep and sincere grief at the irreparable loss at the death of this public-spirited gentleman and passed resolutions conveying to the survivors of the departed worthy their sincere condolence and sympathy. The Local Government of Quetta itself paid a glowing tribute in the shape of a special communique, which eulogised the Khan Bahadur's several services to Government and described him as ""one of Quetta's most useful and highly respected citizens."" In recognition of his valuable services the Khan Bahadur was honoured with the distinguished decorations of Khan Bahadur (1889). Kaiser-i-Hind Medal (1891), C.I.E. (1904), O.B.E. (1920), and was also awarded the unique and most uncommon privilege of being allowed to fly the Union Jack over his mills. He also enjoyed the rank of Honorary Lieutenant of Baluchistan Volunteer Rifles. It may be said about him that it was through dint of sheer patience, preseverance, untiring energy and conscious hard work, and, above all, his great admirable talents, and large non- sectarian charities and loyal fidelity, coupled with his most affable and courteous nature, that he won the hearts of all he came in contact with, thus gradually rising to be the master of millions, occupying a high and unique position in the life of Quetta and winning honours and privileges which fell to the lot of a very few happy personages. He has left behind noble monuments of goodness and real solid, sterling feelings which will ever serve to remind one of a great and generous soul who is no more.

777,LATE RAO BAHADUR HARISHCHANDRA VISHRAM RAJWADKAR,"J.P., retired Gazetted Officer (Bombay Customs Principal Appraiser) of the Government of India, Lower Colaba, Bombay, was born on the 11th October, 1876. He was an outstanding figure in the public life of Bombay with a matchless record of selfless public services to his credit. He first came into public prominence in 1896 when the plague epidemic was ravaging the whole of Bombay including Colaba. The Government had directed the British military soldiers to inspect houses and rooms in carrying on the segregation campaign. When the people were enough agitated over the ingress of these foreigners into their homes he rushed to their rescue, taking on himself the task of inspection and segregation to the hospitals. People who have survived those ravages well re- member even now how his radiant smile cheered the afflicted in their sufferings and how his character proudly stood the moral test when it refused to be bribed by relations of the plague-stricken people. He was awarded a Certificate of Merit in appreciation of those valuable services in the cause of humanity. After the hospital and camp had to be closed down, he strove hard to establish a Free Medical Dispensary in Colaba. The Dispensary has since been handed over to the Municipality. In the Census operations of 1901 and of 1911 he whole-heartedly helped Government which was pleased to confer on him First Class Sanads. Not the least outstanding of his public services was in connection with Mr. Narayan Govind Powar's agitation in 1905 for free and compulsory primary edu- Late Rao Bahadur Harishchandra Vishram Rajwadkar, cation. He convened numerous meetings in Colaba J.P., Bombay. and different parts of Bombay and collected signatures over the Memorial from the residents residing in Colaba of each and every village in the Maharashtra in support of this agitation. But for these great efforts of his the movement would never have received the impetus which it had, nor would the scheme have fructified immediately thereafter. The Society for the Promotion of Education among the masses working at the industrial centres at Parel owes in no small degree its continued activities to his valuable support and co- operation. His services in the cause of the Co-operative movement in 1914 were almost unique. He worked heart and soul in this connection and was able to organise 14 Co-operative Societies among the different poor and backward communities and took great pains to see that they were properly managed. He was instrumental in bringing up many Co-operative Societies in the mill centres both in Bombay and Ahmedabad. The then Governor and the Viceroy congratulated him heartily and honoured him with an invitation for dinner at Ganeshkhind. During the Great War his active and honest co-operation with the Government officers in mitigating the misery caused by the high prices of foodstuffs was simply commendable. He opened twelve cheap grain shops in various localities. When, however, the control was all of a sudden withdrawn, other grain merchants reduced their prices to bring to loss his selfless concern, which was never conducted with an eye to profit, and he suffered heavy loss without demur, During the Great War, when people became nervous, he strained every nerve to ensure and reassure the frightened populace, For these memorable services he was awarded a Special Medal and also a Certificate of Honour in 1919. His services for the success of Shivaji celebrations and for Hindu-Muslim unity were equally commendable. The late Rao Bahadur was also responsible for suggesting valuable im- provements in the fruit and fishing industry of the Presidency as a result of which motor launches were introduced in the fishing industry. 190 The late Rao Bahadur is also remembered in Colaba even to-day for his strenuous efforts for earthquake relief measures and for the attempts that he carried in the directions of Anglo- Vernacular education and a free Maternity Home in the vicinity of Colaba. In recognition of his various meritorious public services he was made Rao Sahib in 1919, Justice of the Peace the same year and Rao Bahadur in 1934. On all these occasions he received congratulatory addresses from leading citizens. The Government officials paid a tribute to the late Rao Bahadur as a ""bright spot"" in the history of the Gauging Department in the Customs and a gentleman of very high honour and sterling virtue."" On his retirement after 35 years' most laudable service, farewell parties were held in his honour by officers and friends. The late Rao Bahadur died on 12th August, 1935.",BOMBAY & SIND.

Her father, late Mr. Madhavrao Rokde, J.P., devoted all his life to the promotion of education among the masses by setting up a school at Mandvi, Bombay. As Shrimati Janabai had received her early educa- tion under the care of her father and imbibed from him the spirit of self-sacrifice, she resolved to devote all her earnings as a trained nurse and midwife to the main- tenance of her father's school, which had been kept going by her brother and sister after their father's demise. Shrimati Janabai handed over this school to the Bombay Municipality in 1922 along with the money which she had collected for this purpose, on condition that it should be conducted free after her father's name in a new and separate building. The Diamond Jubilee of this School was befittingly celebrated at her instance and with the enthusiastic help of old pupils and the general public in 1927 under the Presidency of Sir Leslie Wilson, the then Governor of Bombay. Contributions from past pupils and friends of the School amounted to Rs. 789-8-9. Even the poor persons who owed their primary education to the school readily contributed their humble mites, for they were all inspired by the grateful memory of the good that had been done to them. Mrs. Janabai thought it desirable to publish a small bio- graphy of her dear and great father for free distribution on the Jubilee Day and got the late Mr. K.A. Keluskar, one of the oldest friends of her father and well-wisher of the school, to write a brief sketch of Madhavrao Rokde's Shrimati Janabai Rokde, Justice of the Peace, Bombay. life, which was published and more than 1,200 copies were distributed on the Jubilee Day. She also got Silver Medals struck with an inscription in honour of the Jubilee to be distributed among the pupils, bearing a beautiful impression of Dharma- jirao Rokde, for the photo of the founder of the institution was never taken. These medals were distributed to all the boys in the school together with sweetmeats and the life sketch of the founder of the institution. Mrs. Janabai has agreed to pay monthly charges of the metre and the lights taken at the staircase, library room and the rooms in which a night school belonging to the Social Service League meets. Shrimati Janabai opened in 1924 a Free Maternity Home for poor men after her late sister, Ahalyabai, and has been conducting it very efficiently for the last thirteen years at a great self-sacrifice. She set up in 1925 a Free Reading Room and Library in the name of her late brother, Mr Dharmajirao. This institution has been doing very useful work for the last twelve years and receiving financial support mainly from Mrs. Janabai Rokde. Shrimati Janabai Rokde has been devoting her precious time, energy and money not only to the aforesaid charitable institution, but has ever been ready to help other institutions, associations and movements set on foot to ameliorate the condition of the masses. As a great and good social worker and a true friend of the poor her beneficient services have been duly appreciated by the public and the Government alike. On her appointment as Justice of the Peace prominent citizens of Bombay presented to her a congratulatory address in which a glowing tribute was paid to ""her admirable self-sacrifice in the service of the poor and ignorant masses."" She was also awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind Medal and King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in further recognition of her selfless public services in the year 1925.

804,THE LATE DR. NUSSERWANJI FAKIRJI SURVEYOR,"M.A., B.SC., M.D., D.PH., M.R.C.P., F.C.P.S., was born in the year 1863. It would be difficult to choose a name, especially in India, which could more appropriately and more prominently be associated with a practical effort to advance the science of medicine by means of experiment and expert observation than that of Dr. Surveyor, who was considered to be the best physician of his time. He had a brilliant educational career. He graduated in the year 1885 from the Elphinstone College with distinction. He passed the B.Sc. Exa- mination in 1887 in the first division and obtained the degree of Master of Arts in 1889, carrying away the most coveted distinction of Chancellor's Medal. He passed his L.M. & S. Examination in 1890, having stood in the first class. He passed the M. D. Exami- nation in the year 1892. After taking his L.M. & S. degree he was appoin- ted Demonstrator in Physiology in the Grant Medical College under Col. C. H. L. Meyer. After taking his M. he proceeded to England, where he became M.R.C.P. (London) and D.P.H. (Cambridge), and pro- secuted higher studies in Bacteriology, which became ultimately his speciality and the basis of his renown. In England, in collaboration with another medical practitioner, he wrote some learned papers in Bacteri- ology which were published by the Royal Society of London. In 1896 he was the first man in Bombay to have declared the eruption of plague, and he subsequently worked under Professor Hoffkine in plague research work. He laboured most strenuously, subsisting on a The late Dr. Nusserwanji Fakirji Surveyor, M.A B.Sc., M.D., single cup of cocoa during a whole day. Such hard D.Ph., M.R.C.P., F.C.P.S., Bombay. work to the exclusion of rest, the scorning of delights and leading of laborious days completely shattered his health, and for a full year he had to retire from professional work. On the establishment of a Professorship of Bacteriology at the Grant Medical College he was appointed the first Indian Professor in that subject, and the Bacteriological Laboratory was equipped by him. This post he resigned some time in 1915 on the tenure of office being changed by Government. He acted as a Professor of Materia Medica, Grant Medical College, and was also appointed as Second Physician, Sir J. J. Hospital, which post he enjoyed till his death. This post was hitherto reserved only for I.M.S. officers, being the first Indian to be appointed to this post. He also once acted as the First Physician to the J. J. Hospital. He was Government nominee on the Committee of the Tata Research Institute at Bangalore, for more than ten years a Syndic in Medicine, also once Dean in the Bombay Univer- sity and Secretary to the Bombay Medico-Physical Society. Dr. Surveyor's prominent personal characteristics were an overwhelming sense of duty, love for truth, honesty of purpose and thoroughness in carrying out any work he undertook. As the result of these remarkable characteristics, he won the esteem and regard of the entire medical profession and became a very popular physician in Bombay. In spite of his busy life as a medical practitioner, the late Dr. Surveyor found time to carry on research work on a laborious scale. Owing to his magnetic personality he always made a deep and lasting impression on those who had the privilege of knowing him and he produced remarkable influence on the minds of his pupils and contemporaries, Spartan simplicity, earnestness of soul, precision and promptitude of action, and unvarnished, straightforward speech, marked him in all phases of his life, whether in the onerous discharge of his professional duties, in the wise Councils of the Senate, or in the quietude of his unostentatious home. 199 Not to mention here his deep filial respect, unrestrained love, and passionate devotedness and obedience to his father, would be to applaud him for the least of his good qualities and to ignore his pre-eminent characteristics, to sketch the outline of his picture and not paint it in those hues that constitute its true beauty and charm, to rob his crown of glory of its most resplendent gems. In private life and specially in the midst of his family circles, he was always genial, happy and full of humour. He kept very much to himself, his home and a small circle of his intimate friends and took almost no part in the social life of Bombay. He had a sense of personal and professional dignity which made him absolutely incapable of self-advertising of any kind. He never entered the profession with the intention of making money at any cost. Relieving the distress and suffering of the poor was the main object of his life and there have been instances in which coins he not only refused to take a single farthing from a poor suffering patient but paid a few out of his own purse to them to enable them to buy medicine or articles of nourishment. In him were gentility and innocence SO admirably mixed with the fire of an emotional temperament that his friends were not slow to perceive in him somewhat of the well-balanced turbulence of the restless ocean, now stormy and agitated under the rousing influence of tempestuous blast, then serenely calm, the Spirit of Peace resting upon its glassy bosom, like some unto a have glad conqueror over the scene of recent conflict, forgetful of the past, howsoever rough it may been, and possessed in goodly measure with that chief attribute of nobility-Forgiveness. ism was tender superficial and of a genial quality; in reality he had a noble nature coupled with a loving Dr. Surveyor occasionally exhibited a somewhat cold and cynical manner, but his cynic- and revealed disposition which overflowed with kindness and sympathy. These qualities often times in his attitude towards his patients and his emotional anxiety on their behalf were freely extremely and distressing and painful to witness. At the same time he could speak was his some- mind tient a man of all conviction and hated anything that approached cant or humbug and was was of say hard things on certain questions on which he held strong personal views.

814,MISS NALINI TURKHUD,"novelist and well-known film star, hailing from a reputed Hindu family of Bombay. Her biography, beautifully written by Mr. G. Venkatachellam a well-known Hindu author, is reproduced below It has been the women of India that have conserved till now whatever was beautiful in the life and art of their people and it is they again that are giving the lead in the artistic revival of to-day. The youngest and the most enthusiastic of this group of pioneers is Miss Nalini Turkhud. the only daughter of Mr. Surendra Turkhud of the well-known Turkhud family of Bombay, her grandfather being that great social reformer and the first Dakshini Hindu Sheriff of Bombay, Dr, Atmaram Pandurang Turkhud. Miss Turkhud was born at Poona on the 23rd day of July in the year 1915. She was brought up at Bombay and finished her education at Panchgani. In January, 1929, Captain Mallins of the British Screen Productions, London, saw great possibilities in her and had induced her to appear as the leading lady of his silent film Koh-i-Noor"" but that was the transition period when the talkies were making headway and the silent dying out, hence the idea had to be dropped out. That year's August found her in that International film, Vasantasena,"" which was directed by Mr. Bhavnani and wherein she made a name. Then came Sacred Ganges"" produced by the Oriental Talkies of Lahore. 1933 brought Amrit Manthan,"" 1934 Chandrasena "" and the following year ""Rajput Ramani,"" wherein she proved her mettle as a great tragedienne. She joined the films for the sheer joy of giving expression to her talent and as an outlet for her artistic instincts and to-day she is one of the most gifted of the film stars in India. Young, fair and fresh as a lotus in spring, Miss Turkhud has a fascinating personality. One's first impression is innocence, youthful grace, a shy gentleness that needs encouragement and a perfectly natural and unconscious disdain which is charmingly impressive. Slender almost to a fault, tall for her age, fair-complexioned, a delicately poised head and a bearing lofty and commanding, Miss Turkhud represents a striking type of beauty. Her soft nature, gentle manners, retiring disposition, sweet serenity and her deep religious temperament constitute her charm. She has written a book The Jagirdar of Palna "" and also composes short little lyrics in English and Marathi. Her sketches and paintings, though untrained and crude, reveal her remarkable power of observation and visualization. But above all it is her courage-for she has been the very first Hindu girl of education and culture who has braved public opinion and has ventured forth to act for the screen in spite of the strong opposition and protest from her friends and relatives-that is the strong point in the character of this tender, dreamy child of the Deccan.",BOMBAY & SIND.

820,THE LATE HON'BLE KHAN BAHADUR SARDAR SIR RUSTOM JEHANGIR VAKIL,"KT., J.P., Ahmedabad, was born at Broach on the 24th September, 1878. He was the youngest son of Seth Nasservanji Pestonji Vakil, who was then serving in the Excise Department. Sir Rustom, while at school, was adopted by his uncle, Khan Bahadur Jehangirji Pestonji Vakil, who had no issue, and on the death of his adoptive father Sir Rustom joined business and public life at the early age of 23 in 1901. In 1905 Sir Rustom was elected a member of the Gujarat College Board and of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. He was on various committees of the latter body. He was, for twelve years, Chairman of the Managing Committee and wrote exhaustive and instruc- tive memorandums on the Fire Brigade, Sanitary Market, Methods of Council Debate, etc. In 1907, at the very early age of 29, Sir Rustom was created a Khan Bahadur. He was nominated to the Ahmedabad District Local Board where he was first Vice-President and later President, being the first non- official President. In 1911 Sir Rustom was appointed an Honorary First Class Magistrate and was created a First Class Non-Talukdar Sardar. In 1913 Sir Rustom was elected a member of the then Imperial Legislative Council, being the first Sardar to represent his Order in this Council.

He was the first Parsi of Gujarat to start a cotton mill, and the first in India to be concerned with the manufacture of Magnesium Chloride, a product very largely consumed in cotton mills and till then imported from Germany. The birth of this industry in India was of considerable assistance to the mill industry during the years of the War when the German product was not available. Sir Rustom was Knighted in 1924. In 1930 he entered the Bombay Legislative Council for the second time, contesting the election from both the Ahmedabad City and the Ahmedabad District Non-Mohammadan Consti- tuencies. Sir Rustom was elected from both, which was a certain tribute to his popularity and ability. He had naturally to resign his seat in one of the constituencies and with his usual concern for the rural areas he resigned the Urban seat. In November, 1930, His Excellency Sir Frederick Sykes formed his Cabinet and Sir Rustom was appointed Minister for Local Self-Govern- ment, the first Parsi ever to be appointed a Minister in any Provincial Council. During the period of his office he had brought before the Council and put through Bills which made provincial history, amongst these being the Weights and Measures Act, the City of Karachi Bill and the Village Panchayats Act. The appreciation of Sir Rustom's ministerial work may well be summed up from the following extract from the letter of His Excellency Sir Frederick Sykes written to Lady Vakil on the demise of Sir Rustom have always found his advice most valuable, and his helpfulness and co-operation, at all times, with me and his other colleagues was beyond all praise. We shall all feel the loss of a valued Councillor whose place it will be exceedingly difficult to fill."" 207 Sir Rustom died after a short illness of three days on the 1st November, 1933, and the public tributes paid to his memory were multifarious and glorious. His Excellency Sir Frederick Sykes paid him the greatest tribute by cancelling His Excellency's last public departure from Poona at the short notice of three hours. Sir Rustom was a keen sportsman and an excellent rider. He was a member of various clubs, both here and in England. Sir Rustom died leaving behind his widow, whom he had married in 1901, and six children. He also left surviving him his mother who was then 89 years old.",BOMBAY & SIND.

1020,BALRAMPUR RAJ,"extending over an area of some 1523 square miles forms the biggest Taluqdari estate in Oudh. It has an annual income of about 40 lacs of rupees and a population of more than half a million. The owner of the Estate with the hereditary title of Maharaja is a Rajput of the Janwar clan. The family represents the younger branch of the great Janwar house of Ikauna in Bahraich founded by Barier Shah (son of Raja Mansukhdeo of Pawagarh in Gujarat) who came to Oudh with Firoz Shah Tughlak in 1374 A.D. The illustrious Maharaja Sir Digvijai Singh Bahadur, K.C.S.I., grandfather of the present Maharaja, remained loyal to the British Government in the 1857 Mutiny, giving shelter and protection to various British officers from Gonda and Sakraura including Sir Charles Wingfield. In recognition of his loyal services he was granted the whole of the confiscated Raj of Tulsipur and a large estate in Bahraich. Later he was granted the title of Maharaja Bahadur and invested with the insignia of a Knight Commander of the Star of India. In January, 1877, he was accorded the exceptional distinction of a personal salute of 9 guns. The Balrampur hospital at Lucknow, the hostels and school at Balrampur, etc., are standing monuments of his philanthropic activities. He died in May, 1882, and the Estate then passed to his widow, Maharani Indra Kunwar Saheba, who held the property till her death in June, 1893. On the 29th March, 1893, Her Majesty the Queen-Empress Victoria was graciously pleased to bestow, as a mark of her Royal favour, the continuance to the Maharani Saheba, for her lifetime, of the salute of nine guns. She was succeeded by her adopted son, the late Maharaja Sir Bhagwati Prasad Singh Bahadur, K.C.S.I., K.B.E., who during the Great War served the Empire with exemplary loyalty and devotion in various ways and his services in this connection elicited the warmest approbation from the Government. During his time large additions including the big Taluqa of Ambapur (Gandara) in Bahraich District were made to his Estate. He contributed several lacs of rupees in works of pub'ic utility and benevolence. He died on May 24, 1921, and was succeeded by his son, Maharaja Pateshwari Prasad Singh, the present owner of the Estate. The present Maharaja was born on 2nd January, 1914, and married in November, 1932, the daughter of H. H. the late Maharaja Sir Chandra Shamsher Jung Bahadur Rana, G.C.B., G.C.S.I., G.C.M.G., G.C.K.O., D.C.L. (Oxon), F.R.G.S., Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of Nepal.

1119,MAHMUDABAD. RAJA MOHAMMAD AMIR AHMAD KHAN,"Khan Bahadur, of Mahmudabad, was born on November 5, 1914, and succeeded to the Estate on May 23, 1931. The old and historic Estate of Mah- mudabad consists of 415 villages and 114 patties, paying an annual Government revenue of over four lakhs of rupees. The founder of the family, Qazi Nasrat-Ullah, a Siddiqi Sheikh of Baghdad, came to India and settled at Amroha in the days of Shahab-ud-Din Ghori. Nawab Moham- mad Khan was the founder of the town of Mahmudabad in the reign of Emperor Jahangir. The titles of Raja and Khan Bahadur, conferred by the last King of Oudh, are hereditary in the family. Mahmudabad gained an all-India pro- minence by its association with the illus- trious name of the late Maharaja Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan, Khan Bahadur, father of the present Raja. It was through his efforts that the Muslim University Act was passed and enforced at Aligarh in 1920. As a pioneer of edu- cation his record of achievements was un- equalled in the United Provinces. His princely contributions of Rs. 1,50,000 to the Muslim University at Aligarh, Rs. 50,000 to the King George's Medical College, Lucknow, Rs. 15,000 to the Allah- Raja Mohammad Amir Ahmad Khan, Khan Bahadur, Mahmudabad. abad University and Rs. 36,000 to the Science College, Aligarh, were ample proofs of the keen interest he took in education. The Lucknow University was mainly an outcome of his efforts. He took a prominent part in the inauguration of the Reforms Scheme in 1908, and did his level best to secure the inter-indepen- dence of the Mussalmans as a community. His memorable note on the Muddiman Reforms Enquiry Committee and his strong advocacy before the Lee Commission for the Indianisation of services will ever be gratefully remembered by his countrymen. Maharaja Sir Mohammad Ali Mohammad Khan died on May 23, 1931. His sudden and untimely passing away, in the midst of a vigorously active and eminently useful career, was deeply mourned all over the country. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the present Raja. Raja Mohammad Amir Ahmad Khan, Khan Bahadur, was educated at La Martiniere College, Lucknow. He carries a remarkably wise head upon his young shoulders and is giving at SO early an age every promise of being in every way eminently worthy of his exalted heritage. He is President, Association for the Preservation of Game in U. ; Member, Executive Committee, British Indian Association, Oudh Member, Court of the Lucknow University. He is the first in the family to have gone to Europe. He is a poet of no mean order and has published Persian and Urdu poems of outstanding merit.

The Taluqdar is Sarjupari Brahman by caste and descendant of Raja Birbal, the renowned Minister of the Moghal Empire and one of the nine gems of the Court of Abkar the Great (1556-1605). Another ancestor of his, Pandit Nagmal Pandey, brother of Raja Birbal, was a profound scholar in Astrology and Sanskrit. The Emperor held him in high esteem and had appointed him as one of his Counsellors. In the reign of Jehangir, Pandit Nagmal's son, Pandit Surajmal Pandey, was appointed Manager for Irsal of Subedars of Ajmer, Allahabad, Oudh, etc. He was responsible for the collection of reve- nues from the Subedars and the safe deposit of the same in the Royal Treasury. His successors occu- pied that position for six generations. In 1738 A.D. Nawab Sa'adat Khan, Subedar of Oudh, borrowed as usual several lacs of rupees from Pandey Nawasi Ram, a descendant of Raja Surajmal Pandey in the sixth generation, to pay to Nadir Shah; but before the money was repaid to Pandeyjee Sa'adat Khan breathed his last. Pandey Nawasi Ram sent his son, Pandey Baldi Ram, to Oudh for realisation of the said amount from Abdul Mansur Khan, son- in-law of Sa'adat Khan. Pandey Baldi Ram stayed there for a long time and at last the Nawab ordered him to realise the said money from the Nizamat of Gonda and Bahraich. Thus, on the death of Pandey Nawasi Ram, Pandey Baldi Ram settled in Pargana Ikauna of district Bahraich and called there his family from Delhi. In the days of Raja Sheo Prasad of Gonda, Pandey Bhawan Ram, the grandson of Pandey Baldi Ram, and Pandey Chain Ram, his cousin, came to Gonda. They possessed immense wealth and provided the Raja with three lacs of rupees to Bhaiya Jagdish Datt Ram Pandey, Taluqdar, Singha Chanda pay the revenue on the occasion when he was seized and Ramnagar Raj, Oudh. by the Nazim. The Raja was unable to pay the amount and consequently gave up some vlllages to Pandeys who henceforward remained in Gonda. They made large additions to this Estate in Gonda both by purchase and grant, and gradually became owners of one of the chief Estates in the district. Their great wealth secured to them the respect of Nazims, for without their assistance little of the revenue would ever have been paid. Pandey Bhawan Ram, the founder of the Taluqas, Singha Chanda and Akbarpur, was a noted warrior and wielded immense influence in the district. He fought and defeated the Raja of Amroha when he raised the standard of revolt against the King of Oudh. For this achieve- ment he was granted the Zemindari of Taluqa Retwagara. He had three sons, Pandey Mardan Ram, Pandey Karya Ram and Pandey Bakhtawar Ram. They were also noted warriors. They fought in Deccan on behalf of the Nawab of Oudh and after victory the village of Manderwa was granted to him as Khilat. of Pandey Kishen Ram, one of the four sons of Pandey Karya Ram. Pandey Ram Datt Pandey Bhawan Ram died in 1842 and was succeeded by Pandey Ram Datt Ram, Ram son 300 raised the influence and power of the family to its highest glory by his practice of standing sure- ties for the Zemindars. He obtained mortgages on villages after villages which thus passed into his possession, while the old proprietors were generally content to receive liberal allotments of rent-free land. The Pandeys almost invariably treated their tenants and the ex-proprietors well, for their services were required when any fighting was to be done. Pandey Ram Datt Ram became a power in the land, for all the Taluqdars of the district were dependent on him. He drove out the Raja of Tulsipore on behalf of the Maharaja of Balrampur and afterwards allowed him to return and assisted the Raja in restoring order in his Estate. He also helped the Maharaja of Balrampur in driving out the Naib of the Estate who had somehow become SO viciously influen- tial that the Maharaja could not get rid of him. In addition to the Nizam of Gonda and Bahraich, the Nizams of Sultanpore, Fyzabad, etc., the decendants of Raja Inchal Singh, Wajid Ali Khan and Maharaja Man Singh used to borrow thousands of rupees from him when there was defici- ency in the kist money. Moreover, he used to help them on necessary occasions with his own arms and forces. In 1849 D. Ram Datt Ram held the two large Estates of Singha Chanda and Akbar- pur, paying a revenue of Rs. 1,66,475. He died in 1850 A.D. and his brother, Pandey Kishen Datt Ram, began to manage the Estate affairs. He was awarded the title of Raja by the Nawab of Oudh, and not long after Mr. Sleeman, the British Resident, secured the title of Raja to Pandey Ganesh Datt Ram, son of Pandey Ram Datt Ram. Raja Kishen Datt Ram Pandey made several additions to the Estate both by acquisition and purchase. On receiving the Royal Order, he cleared off the Koeli Jungle and populated the same. In lieu of these services he was granted the land of the said Jungle as Zamindari. At regular settlement in his time the Taluqa Singha Chanda comprised no less than 2,21,822 acres, paying a revenue of Rs. 2,20,982. After the death of Raja Kishen Datt Ram Pandey a long litigation ensued and the Estate broke into three portions, one of which was inherited by Bhaiya Ambika Datt Ram Pandey, the father of the present Taluqdar. He managed the Estate well and treated the tenants as if they were his own children. During the Great War he helped the British Government by supplying many recruits, both combatants and non-combatants, and liberally purchasing War Bonds and was awarded a gold watch and many Sanads by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief. He died suddenly in June, 1921, and was succeeded by his son, Bhaiya Jagdish Datt Ram Pandey, the present Proprietor of the Raj. He received his education at Colvin Taluqdars' School, Lucknow. At school he proved a brilliant scholar of exemplary habits as well as a fine sportsman. His achievements in sports won for him the position of Captainship and his photo- graph as head of the Captains is still to be seen in the Common Room of the institute. He used to take a most prominent part in the activities of the school. After passing the High School Examination he joined the Christian College of Commerce and took the degree of B. Com. in Book Keeping and Typewriting in 1926, standing in the first division in Book Keeping and in the second division in Typewriting. He took up the management of his Estate in the same year under the supervision of the Court of Wards and soon won the respect and admiration of the entire working staff of the Court of Wards for his exceptionally brilliant intellect, his remarkably high character and scrupulous rectitude of behaviour. The Estate was released from the Court of Wards in February, 1928, and Bhaiya Jagdish Datt Ram Pandey has since been managing his Estate with consummate ability and success. Educated and cultured and generous by nature, he has turned out an ideal Taluqdar. The moral and material welfare of his ryots is always his first consideration. He is of an intensely charitable disposition and liberally helps the poor and the needy. During the last several years of scarcity and slump in prices he has helped his tenants by allowing further remissions to the extent of Rs. 35,000 above and besides the Government remissions. He is a member of Aman Sabha, District Board and the Executive Committee of the British Indian Association of Oudh, President of local Hindi Sahitya Kavi Sammelan Society and Boy Scouts Association and is prominently associated with many other public institutions. He takes interest in every work of public utility and contributes liberally to its funds. He is held in the highest esteem by all classes of people for his profound learning, devoted patriotism, sturdy independence and keen public spirit. Side by side with the above he is endowed with all the esteemable qualities of head and heart which distinguished his father and grandfather, specially their munificence. He is in every way a worthy successor of his eminent predecessors. He is equally pious and nothing is dearer to his heart than to maintain the noble traditions of the family which he SO worthily represents. His zeal for public good and instinctive desire for social regeneration find an ample demonstration in the great confidence both the public and the officials repose in him and the benevolent activities which enlighten this early stage of his life. He is endowed with great physical strength and vigour and is fond of all sorts of muscular games. He is in every way and every sense a model Taluqdar. To know the real condition and requirements of his ryots he makes a tour in his Estate every year. His public spirit is on a par with his loyalty to the Crown. Any movement aiming at public good, whether started by the Government or the public, can count upon his active support and encouragement. It is the privilege and distinction of the present Taluqdar to have noted the tendencies of the times and, with an eye to the future, to have decided upon adopting a form of administration not only more efficient but more in accord with modern notions and requirements. In private life he is the pick of courtesy and affability and is accessible to all and sundry, high or low. He is literally adored by his tenants to whom he is more than a father. He has been appointed a Special Magistrate and nominated a member of the Advisory Committee of the Court of Wards of the Gonda district.",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA

1173,PAYAGPUR RAJA BIRENDRA BIKRAM SINGH,"C.I.E., of Payagpur, Distt. Bahraich. was born in 1907. He belongs to a Rajput family of the Janwar clan which traces its descent from Raja Mansukh Deo of Pawagarh in Gujarat, who was in direct line of suc- cession from the Pandava Prince, Arjun. Bariar Shah, the youngest of the six sons of Raja Mansukh Deo, came to Oudh as a Risaldar of the Imperial Army of Delhi to clear out of the Province the unruly marauders by whom it was then infested. As a reward of his success he was granted by the Emperor the whole tract of country which he brought into order. One of Bariar Shah's descendants, Prag Shah, settled in the tract where lie the present family domains and which came to be named after him as Pryagpur or Payagpur. The hereditary title of Raja was bestowed by the Mohammadan Rulers upon Himmat Singh, one of the two sons of Prayag Shah. He was killed in feud by a rival Raja and the estate passed to his son and grandson, during whose time the property suffered much at the hands of oppressive Nizams, the whole country being plun- dered and laid waste. At the time of annexation of Oudh the property was held by Raja Narpat Singh, from whom it was inherited by his son, Raja Mohendra Bahadur Singh. The latter, dying after four years, was succeeded by his son, Raja Bhupendra Bikram Singh, who made many improvements in the Estate. He established the Crosthwaite Charitable Dispensary and the La Touche Anglo-Vernacular School, and did many other acts of public good, for which he was honoured with the title of C.I.E. by the British Government. He died in 1905 and was succeeded by Raja Bindeshwari Prasad Singh who founded the Meston Female Hospital and Clarke's Library in Payagpur. He died in 1918 at an early age of 29. Raja Birendra Bikram Singh, C.I.E., M.L.C., the present Proprietor of the Estate, succeeded his father in 1918. Being a minor the Estate was placed under the management of the Court of Wards until 1927, when the Raja came of age and assumed full powers of administration. He was educated at the Colvin Taluqdars' College and the Lucknow Christian College where he distinguished himself both as a student and a lover of manly games. He is a fine sportsman, a good polo-player, a crack shot and an adept swimmer. He is a thorough gentleman and a friend of the needy. An orthodox follower of the ancient Hindu religion, his charity is always sought for by religious associations in the country.

Sindhu, sixth in descent from him, and his son Rup Chand received baptism direct from Guru Arjan Dev and Guru Har Gobind Sahib respectively. In recognition of his services to the Sikh cause Guru Har Gobind Sahib called Bhai Rup Chand his own brother. Hence the family name Bhaika. The high respect and honour in which the family is held by the Sikh Princes, Chiefs and people is also due to the fact that it was laid down by the last Guru that the descendants of Bhai Rup Singh were to be looked upon as his own descendants. Bagrian, the present head- quarters of the family, was presented in 1754 by the Moghul Governor to Bhai Gudar Singh, great-grandfather of Bhai Rup Singh. The Estate of Bagrian now consists of twenty-nine villages with an annual gross income of about a lakh of rupees. Bhai Sampuran Singh, grandfather of the present Chief, rendered great material help to the British during the Kabul War of 1848 and in the dark days of the Mutiny.

1325,RAI BAHADUR LALA BENARSI DASS,"the foremost citizen of Ambala Cantonment, a leading Rais, Banker, Millowner, far-famed philanthropist and an outstanding figure in the public life of the Punjab in the most comprehensive sense of the term, was born on October 15, 1871. He is the present head of an old banking firm of pre-Mutiny days and the sole proprietor of one of the largest Steam Roller Flour Mills in India, an up-to-date Ice Factory and a large Agricultural Farm in the District of Saharanpur. But he is best known, not only in the Punjab but far beyond the confines of the Province, for his numerous public benefactions regardless of expenditure and embracing not a few of the many outstanding aspects of human progress and happiness. Rai Bahadur's father, Lala Ganeshi Lall, was a Viceregal Durbari and a Member of the Saddar Bazar Committee and wielded immense influence in his time. He had helped the Government in various ways, especially in the dark days of the Mutiny. According to Captain E. Howard, the then Canton- ment Magistrate, ""he supplied Govern- ment with money most willingly when demanded from him' and also raised a temporary loan for Government from residents of the Saddar Bazar. He was also immensely helpful during the famine of 1861 in contributing and col- lecting money for the destitute. Rai Bahadur Benarsi Das has not only thoroughly maintained but con- siderably advanced the traditions of his family for charity, public spirit and loyalty to the Crown. The place of eminence that he enjoys in public esti- R. B. Lala Benarsi Das, Rais, Banker and Millowner, Ambala Cantt. mation, both in his own Province and beyond, is due as much to his numerous estimable qualities of head and heart as to his large-hearted philanthropy and boundless munificence. It is impossible within the brief compass of this sketch to describe in detail his numerous services to the public and the Government. We will just refer to a few of the more notable ones. He founded a High School in Ambala Cantonment in 1913 and endowed it with a sum of Rs. 2,50,000. The school has a fine up-to-date building, a magnificent hostel and excellent play-grounds. It has about a thousand scholars on its roll and is admittedly one of the best conducted schools in the Province. This great act of public usefulness has been highly appreciated by the Government and the public. As His Honour Sir Michael O'Dwyer, in his capacity as Lieutenant-Governor, so aptly put in the school log book, "" the school meets a real want in the Cantonment."" Another crying need of Ambala, namely, a Women's Hospital, was met by Rai Bahadur in 1923 with a characteristically liberal hand. As Shakespeare has rightly said, sweet mercy is nobility's true badge."" This efficiently equipped Women's Hospital, founded at a cost of 31 lakhs and opened by Her Excellency Lady Maclagan, was an outcome of his compassion for the suffering womenfolk in the ordinary run of life. It provides free medical service to women and children, irrespective of race and creed, and free food and lodging to poor patients. A lady 355 M.B., B.S. is in charge of it assisted by a House Surgeon and a number of qualified nurses. It costs Rai Bahadur Rs. 24,000 annually to maintain it. In July, 1932, Col. G.P. Goil, I.M.S., very favourably reviewed the working of this hospital and profusely congratulated Rai Bahadur. Not the least noteworthy of his many golden deeds is the Rai Bahadur Benarsi Dass Trust at Lahore. In December, 1932, in thankfulness to God for his narrow escape from a diabo- lical attack on his life by a set of adventurers, he gave out, for the benefit of the Hindu community, a large property consisting of Oil Mills, Cotton Baling Press and Ice Factory and a block of buildings worth seven lakhs of rupees. This property is under the management of an influential Trust. As a Member of the Cantonment Committee for years he has rendered valuable public services. Col. Campbell, Cantonment Magistrate, paid him a glowing tribute in this connection. As Ruskin so incisively puts it, 'e verybody likes to be good, but not one in a hundred finds this out."" Rai Bahadur Lala Benarsi Dass is one of those blessed few. It is always his best endeavour to make his wealth a blessing to his brethren. Besides maintaining, at his own expense, a first-class High School, a magnificent Women's Hospital and an up-to-date Library and Reading Room, he contributes generously to every fund raised by the Government or the public for the relief of human distress. His services during the plague epidemics of 1903 and 1904, both in his personal capacity and as Vice-President of the Plague Committee, are unforgettable. Again, during the influenza epidemic of 1918 he started an Influenza Hospital where medicines and milk were given free to the poor. For the relief of middle class people who felt shy of going to hospital he organised itinerant services through two Sub-Assistant Surgeons. The Canton- ment Committee, in a special resolution, eulogised this ""good and philanthropic work."" Tender-hearted by nature, he was extremely pained to hear the shocking news of the Behar Earthquake. To afford some immediate relief to sufferers he sent two waggon loads of atta worth Rus. 2,000. This generous act of his was highly appreciated by His Excellency the Viceroy. As Vice-President of the Kurukshetra Restoration Society, formed in 1918, Rai Bahadur Lala Benarsi Dass has to his credit an achievement which has entitled him to the blessing and gratitude of all Hindu India. The holy tank of Kurukshetra, one of the largest historical tanks in Northern India, had become absolutely dry. To fill it up Rai Bahadur brought a stream of water from Ladwa, 16 miles from the great lake, which was styled after him as Benarsi Dass Kurukshetra Chautang Channel. Thanks to his generosity and noble-mindedness, this sacred tank is now serving as a fresh bathing tank to millions of Hindu pilgrims from all parts of India. A well with a pump on it has been constructed by Rai Bahadur in the compound of Gitabhawan which supplies very sweet cold water to thousands of pilgrims visiting the most illustrious institution in the holy land. To help the noble cause of the promulgation of Gita philosophy undertaken by the Society he gave a gold medal to be awarded to the best competitor in Gita exposition and contributes liberally towards the monthly expenses of the Primary School maintained by the Society. As Emerson says, ""the manly part is to do, with might and main, what you can do."" The record of Rai Bahadur's public services may well be said to be a striking illustration of this great saying. His total charities with endowments amount to over twenty lakhs of rupees. Rai Bahadur has always proved, by word and deed, a devotedly loyal subject of the Crown. He built Lord Roberts' Pavilion at Ambala in 1915 at a cost of Rs. 20,000 in memory of His Lordship's friendship with his revered father. On the outbreak of the Great War he offered the largest individual subscription in the District. He placed his Benarsi Das Steam Roller Flour a loan of two lakhs of rupees free of interest. He invested Rs. 1,51,000 in the War Loans, Mills at the disposal of Government for helping military supplies and did a lot of commendable work as Vice-President, St. John Ambulance Committee; Member, War Loan Committee, Ambala were and as a chief promoter of all the movements connected with the War. His War services highly appreciated by Government. ",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA

1358,LATE KHAN SAHIB RISALDAR KHAN DAURAN KHAN,"Honorary Magistrate. Zaildar, Sangla Hill, District Sheikhupura, was the worthy head of one of the best known historic families in the Punjab noted for its prowess, public spirit and steadfast loyalty to the Crown. He was a leading representative of the famous Bhatti Rajput clan who have their headquarters at Pindi Bhattian in the district of Gujranwala. The ancient Bhatneer, now called Bikaneer, was the original home of the Bhatti Rajputs. During some dynastic revolution they found it necessary to leave their native land and settled in the Punjab. Mian Wilayat Khan (grand- father of Khan Sahib) and his brother, Mian Fatteh Khan, considerably helped the British with provi- sions and personal services during the Sikh Wars. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 both brothers were equally conspicuous in their fidelity and allegiance to Government. In token of his ""loyal and faithful conduct to the State Mian Wilayat Khan was honoured with a pair of Gold Bracelets by Government, and Mian Fatteh Khan was glowingly praised by high officers for his heroic help in the expedition to Bulla in the Karnal district in those dark days for the collection of revenue and for his gallant conduct at the head of his Risala at Delhi. The certificates granted to them from time to time during the period from 1863 to 1864 for valuable services rendered to Govern- ment are too numerous to be mentioned in detail. Khan Sahib's father, Khan Mohammad Murad Bux, took scrupulous care, both in his private and public dealings, to tread in his illustrious father's footsteps. He had, in the words of Col. Popham Young, C.I.E., high reputation for honesty,"" and was equally respected by the public and the officials for his high character and loyalty to Government.

In 1901 he was made Zaildar and was granted the same year a special certificate for valuable assistance to the Criminal Administration of the district and subsequently many other Sanads and testimonials for ""useful assistance to Government officials in all Departments."" He was described in 1902 by Mr. R.D Spencer, District Superintendent of Police, Sheikhupura, as one of the best Zaildars in the district."" During the intense excitement and agitation in the Lyallpur district in 1907 over the Colony Bill he worked splendidly in allaying the fears and apprehensions of the Zamindars and thereby averting what portended to be a serious disturbance. He received various certificates from high officers for this valuable service. As is well known, his public spirit had ever been on a par with his loyalty to Government. He served the public with singular devotion whenever an occasion arose for the same. His magnificent work during plague epidemics may well be said to constitute an outstanding glory of his life. Not the least remarkable demonstration of his public spirit consisted in his work as a Member and Vice-Chairman of the Sangla Hill Municipality from 1900 to 1924 and Member, District Board, from 1898 to 1935. till He was appointed Honorary Magistrate in 1911, and ever since his appointment marked his sudden death in June 1937, he was discharging his duties in this responsible capacity with Judge ability and tact and with exemplary honesty and impartiality. He worked as Honorary Civil from 1916 to 1928, giving all through his career in that capacity a highly creditable account of himself. in His sincere loyalty to the Crown could not have been more strikingly illustrated than the energy and devotion with which he served the Empire during the Great War.

1360,RAI BAHADUR BAWA DINGA SINGH,"Managing and Senior Partner of Messrs. Spedding Dinga Singh & Co., Premier Timber Merchants, Railway and Government Contractors, Lahore, originally a resident of Vairowal Bawian, District Amritsar, is a direct descendant of Guru Angad Dev, the second Sikh Guru, and the greatest favourite of the great Sikh Guru Nanak Dev. The Bawa family of Goindwal and Vairowal is well known in the Punjab and commands the respect and reverence of Sikhs and Hindus alike as much for their eminent spiritual position as for their many estimable qualities of head and heart. The Bawa Sahib has proved in every way a worthy representative of the family and enjoys the esteem of all classes of people for his piety and generosity combined with a commanding intellect and rare business acumen. Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh was born in 1883 and received his education at Amritsar till 1900, when, leaving his studies, he joined Government service. But Government service providing no scope for his brilliant intelligence and enterprising brain, he gave it up in 1907 and joined his father's timber business. From the moment he did so, thanks to his industry and enterprise, his business began to grow by leaps and bounds. He took over the famous firm of Messrs. Spedding and Co., the oldest and biggest European firm in Timber Trade in Northern India. The name of the firm was changed into Messrs. Spedding Dinga Singh & Co. On his father's death in 1910 it fell to his lot to support a large family-brothers and sisters, unmarried. His brothers, after having been educated, are now doing their own business. In 1922 the Punjab Forest Department entered into partnership with Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh in the Talwara Saw Mills scheme. The Bawa Sahib undertook to finance that scheme up to sixteen lakhs of rupees. Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh is devotedly loyal to the British Raj and often at critical times he has devotedly helped the Government. During the Great War he helped the Government in various ways. He gave handsome amounts to the various War funds and subscribed liberally to the War Loans. He also supplied thousands of tons of sleepers and sawn timber to Mesopo- tamia, Salonika, etc. During the Afghan War of 1919 a very big order was placed with Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh to be completed in two months, but he carried it out within a few days and to the entire satisfaction of the authorities. On the occasion of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales' visit to Lahore Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh was appointed by His Excellency the Governor a Member of the Punjab Provincial Reception Committee and also a Member of the Decoration Sub-Committee. He discharged his duties creditably and also contributed Rs. 2,500 on the occasion. Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh has been a nominated Member of the Punjab Forest Board for the last 10 years. He has also been President of the Punjab Timber Trades Association for the last 10 years, of which all the Conservators of N. I. Forests and leading firms of timber merchants are members. Rai Bahadur Bawa Dinga Singh spares neither pains nor money to serve both the public and the Government. His contributions to various public funds and in the service of the Govern- ment and the public amount to thousands of rupees. Every movement aiming at public good can count upon his heartiest support and encouragement. He takes special interest in education, having already contributed Rs. 15,000 to Vairowal Public School which has been handed over to the District Board. He is extremely kind-hearted, his heart almost bleeding for the poor. His purse is always open for public good and for the relief of human distress, irrespective of race and creed. He gave a handsome amount for the relief of sufferers during the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1926. He has also given Rs. 16,000 for Montmorency Hall and Tube Wells at Kot Lakhpat; Rs. 5,000 to Lahore Zoo; Rs. 3,000 for D. M. College, Moga, at an annual prize distribution where he presided Rs. 6,000 for Sanatan Dharam College, Lahore, of which he was for several years Vice-President. For years he contributed to the funds of this College a monthly sum in addition to decent sums as occasions arose. He presided over the Bar Sanatan Dharam Confer- ence at Lyallpur and contributed on that occasion Rs. 5,000 for various funds, especially for girls' education. The above are only a few outstanding instances of his munificence. His annual charity is between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 25,000. For his various public services he was honoured with the title of Rai Bahadur in 1930. 371",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA
1361,KHAN BAHADUR MIAN AHMAD YAR KHAN DAULATANA,"M.L.A., the elder Mian Ghulam Qadir Khan and grandson of Mian Ghulam Mohammad Khan, the son of Chief of the Daultanas of Luddan, in the Multan District, was born at Luddan on the 13th renowned April, 1896. He is a worthy scion of an old and historic family of loyal and influential landholders universally respected for their innate nobility and large-heartedness. The family belongs to a sub-division of the Joya clan, a distinguished branch of the Jats, having a population of about 9 lakhs living in Multan, Montgomery, Ferozepur, Rohtak Districts and Bahawalpur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jaipur States. His grandfather, Mian Ghulam Mohammad Khan, enjoyed the esteem and affection of all classes of people for his simple habits, high spirituality, great kindliness of heart and boundless munificence. Mian Ghulam Kadir Khan was a worthy son of his father in his religious fervour, generosity and simplicity of manners. He, however, met with untimely death during the lifetime of his father while on a pilgrimage to the Holy Ka'aba. The charge of Mian Ahmad Yar Khan, then a mere boy, accordingly devolved upon the aged grandfather, who, however, did not survive long the shock of his son's sad and premature death, and the boy and his property were taken under the protection of Government under the Court of Wards, Multan District. Mian Ahmad Yar Khan was sent to the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore, for further studies. Endowed with intelligence of a very high order, he gave in the College an exceptionally brilliant K. B. Mian Ahmad Yar Khan account of himself, winning four out of five medals of the College. Daulatana, M.L.A. For his many estimable qualities of head and heart he enjoyed the affection and confidence of his Professors and comrades and was the recipient of the much-coveted Rivaz Medal for good conduct. He founded the Chiefs' College Dramatic Club and has ever since been prominently associated with its activities. He got the Chiefs' College Diploma in 1917. He then read in Government College, Lahore, for one year and nine months and when he was preparing for his Intermediate Examination he was called to his Estate for recruitment work in connection with the Great War. All through that titanic struggle Mian Ahmad Yar Khan devoted himself whole-heartedly to the service of the Empire. He supplied over a hundred recruits from his Estate and contributed more than three lakhs of rupees to various War Funds including the War Loan. He was released of the Court of Wards' control in 1920 and in the following year was elected unopposed to the first Reformed Council from the Western Multan Mohammadan Constituency, where he has done much useful work. He was re-elected in 1926 from the same constituency, but this time he had to contest his seat and won it by a majority of 1,835 votes. In 1930 he was re- turned again to the Council as a representative of the Punjab Mohammadan landholders, securing 962 votes against 490 of his opponent, Pir Mohammad Hussain. In the elections of 1937 under the new Constitution he was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly by an overwhelming majority of votes against his opponent, Khan Dost Mohammad Khan Khowgani of Multan. Mian Ahmad Yar Khan has fully inherited all the great and noble qualities of his grandfather and father and is immensely popular with all classes of people for his high character, keen intellect and many eminent social qualities. Speaking at the dinner party given to him at Lahore by the Hon'ble Ministers, leaders of the parties and other members of the Punjab Legislative Council, the Hon'ble Sir Henry Craik, K.C.S.I., C.S.I., Finance Member, Punjab Government, referred to Mian Ahmad Yar Khan in the following enthusiastic terms :- ""I should like, if I may, to pay a special tribute to my friend, Khan Bahadur Mian Ahmad Yar Khan Doultana, the genial Whip of the National Unionist Party, who is responsible for all the arrangements for our entertainment. I congratulate him on their complete success. Geniality tells SO much in many spheres of life and keeps our social relations pleasant. I am not sure which we appreciate most in the Council. I have an equal admiration for both of them and a no less sincere admiration for his many social qualities."" Since the release of his property from the Court of Wards he has been managing his Estate with consummate ability, and has been devoting more time to politics and social work than to his own affairs. He is Chief Secretary of the Unionist Party. The success which the party has achieved in the Punjab Assembly is mostly due to his genius and efforts. His eldest son, Mian Mumtaz Mohammad Khan, is a graduate of the Punjab University Bibi and is now in Carfus Christ College, Oxford. His two daughters, Bibi Mehrafroze and Taugir, are receiving their education at Queen Mary's College, Lahore. 372 D.",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA

Owing to his intimate knowledge of the Ilaqa, Saiyid Murad Shah rendered material assistance during the siege. He was authorized to raise a body of troops and was stationed at Shorkot to prevent reinforcement being sent to the Sikh Camp at Multan and to preserve order in that part of the country. In one of the skirmishes a horse was killed under him which gave rise to a report of his death. He rendered excellent services to Government in the days of Mutiny and captured some 81 mutineers of the late 69th and 62nd Regiments, Native Infantry. In recognition thereof Sir John Lawrence presented him with a Sanad and a Khil'at of the value of Rs. 200.

He displayed splendid devotion to the person of the minor Prince, Nawab Mohammad Sadiq Khan IV when he was installed on the throne ofa the State on the 17th March, 1866, on the sudden death of his father, Nawab Mohammad Bahawal Khan and when some mischievous people, getting Sahibzada Jafar Khan out of prison, inaugurated him as the rival ruler in the Dirawar Fort and thus caused a disturbance. The life of the boy Ruler was in grave jeopardy and he took him in his protection and arrested Jafar Khan. He excavated Minchin Wah and Ford Wah Canals running through waste and desert lands, is where even water had to be carried for the use of the labourers employed on the works, and now one of the best cultivated portions of the State.

Mohammad Abdul Jalil Shah, after getting his education at the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore, went to England where he studied for a long time. His English education and spirit of loyalty place him on a level with the native aristocracy. His second son, Mohammad Nawaz Shah, is retired E. A. C., who did excellent work in connection with recruitment, War Loans and in the days of the Indus Flood in 1928, and was awarded Sanads by the Government.

A detailed history of the family which he so worthily repre- sents is to be found in Sir Lepel Griffin's Chiefs and Families of Note."" The founder of the family, Hazrat Abul Fazal Jamaluddin Mohammad Yusuf, a direct descendant of Imam Hussain, migrated from Gardez near Ghazni and settled at Multan in the year 1088. He was a saint in the most literal sense of the term. The present city of Multan was formed around his abode, which eventually became his shrine and a place of pilgrimage for votaries from far and near in their thousands. Several firmans in the possession of the family from the various Emperors of Delhi show the respect and position they enjoyed in Mughal times. Sayed Ghulam Hyder Shah Gardezi was great-grandfather of the subject of this sketch and was the first to leave Multan and found the village now known as Salarwahan. He owned about sixteen Sayed Mohammad Bagar Shah Gardezi, Landlord and Rais, Salarwahan Kohna, thousand bighas of land. He was much District Multan, with his two sons, Sayed Ghulam Haidar Shah and Sayed Karim Haidar Shah. respected Zaildar and Provincial Durbari. He was held in the highest esteem by the officials, the surrounding Zamindars and the public at large for his loyalty, high character and selfless public spirit. He was invited to the Duke of Connaught and Viceroy's Darbar at Lahore in 1886 on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and to different Provincial Durbars since 1882 till his death in 1905. He was recipient of the highest praise and glowing certificates from officials for lifelong services to every department of the Administration. He was one of the very best men in the district,"" said Mr. Charles Roe, Deputy Commissioner, in his certificate. To quote the certificate of a Divisional Judge, ""he is a man of great influence. I had much pleasure in seeing some of his Sanads dating from Diwan Mulraj's time. He received a reward for his services in the Mutiny."" By a strange fatality of Fate, within fourteen years from 1904 three generations of the family were wiped off by the cruel hand of death. Sayed Ghulam Hyder Shah's only son, Sayed Mohammad Hussain Shah, died in 1904, leaving behind two minor sons-Sayed Mohammad Jaffar Shah and Sayed Mehdi Shah. Unable to bear the shock of his only son's sudden death, Sayed Ghulam Hyder Shah died in 1905. The Estate, with its income of about Rs. 80,000, went to the Court of Wards. In 1911 Sayed Mehdi Shah passed away, leaving behind a minor son, Sayed Mohammad Nawaz Shah, and in 1918 Sayed Mohammad Jaffar Shah died, leaving behind his only son, Sayed Mohammad Baqar Shah, the present head of the family. Sayed Mohammad Hussain Shah rendered valuable services to different departments of Government and got a number of certificates in his own name. Sayed Mohammad Jaffar Shah, during his brief career, after attaining majority, as head of the family, was made Zaildar and Provincial Durbari and served the Government faithfully and energetically in every department. During the Great War he supplied fifteen recruits and a good number of camels and contributed Rs. 12,000 to the War Loans. He got a number of Sanads be and certificates from the different high officials. The Estate in the meantime continued to managed under the Court of Wards Act. His premature death was deeply mourned all over the Ilaqa and beyond. Sayed Mohammad Baqar Shah and his cousin, Sayed Mohammad Nawaz Shah, were at that time studying at Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore. 378 Sayed Mohammad Baqar Shah is the recognised head of the family in his father's place and is Zaildar and included in the category of Sardars and Jagirdars by exemption from the opera- tions of the Arms Act. He has been doing his utmost to maintain the family traditions of ardent loyalty and devoted service to the Crown and trying his level best to follow in every way in the footsteps of his illustrious great-grandfather. During the Great War he energetically served the Empire with men and money in combination with his father. In 1918 Mr. H. W. Emerson, Settlement Officer (now His Excellency the Governor of the Punjab), in a certificate deplored the untimely death of his father and warmly commended his (Syed Baqar Shah's) camp services. In another certificate Mr. Emerson thus referred to his importaut services in connection with the new assessment There was at first organised opposition but I am glad to say that Baqar Shah finally used his influence in the right way."" Besides the above, Syed Mohammad Bagar Shah has received a number of Sanads and certificates for efficient services from different departments. Mr. G.A. Beaty, Superintendent of Police, pays him the following notable tribute He is a quiet well-behaved young man. He is doing quite well There has been not much crime in his Zail, probably due to his influence."" He took active part in the Royal Silver Jubilee celebrations and contributed a handsome amount to the Jubilee Fund. He was awarded Silver Jubilee Medal and a special letter of thanks from His Excellency the Governor.

He is a silent but assiduous worker with all the eminent qualities of head and heart required for a good and great physician. His life, like the lives of great men, is full of joys and sorrows, an inspiring narrative of divine changes from good to better until its present culmination to all that is highest and noblest. It is full of lessons for the aspiring. He is the son of the renowned Hakim Mohammad Ismail Khan, for a long time Royal Physician of the Afghan Government. Disgusted with bitter party feelings, which were so common in Kabul in those days, often leading to bloodshed, he left his native place for good and became Shahi Hakim to the Royal family of Oudh.

At the age of 16 he became a clerk on Rs. 30 in the Commissariat Department and was soon after sent to China in connection with the Boxer Rebellion. Here he studied Chinese privately, passing with credit both the Colloquial and High Proficiency Examinations, and was appointed by the British Legation, on 100 dollars a month, a teacher of Chinese to British officers. He travelled all over China with the Royal Commission as an interpreter. He became so popular with both British officers and Chinese nobles as to have been honoured with farewell parties with printed addresses on the eve of his departure for India. On return home he joined the Lahore Medical School and, after four years' assiduous labour, stood first with the unique distinction of getting 15 certificates testifying to standing at the top in all the different subjects of the profession. 405 In the very beginning of his career as Sub-Assistant Surgeon in the he fortunate enough to have cured Sir George Roos-Keppel, the then Chief Commissioner, of trouble and to have received from him a handsome cash reward.

The certificates he has received in this respect from high officers run into a volume, and they are all of them glowing ones too. For instance, Major G. H. Scott, Commandant, N.-W. Militia, in 1918, wrote He is the most satisfactory Chowdhri that I have had to deal with. It is no easy matter to ration a large and scattered Corps like the N.-W. Militia and it speaks well for Rochi Ram's powers of organisation that he should SO rarely give cause for complaint. His services have been recognised by his selection as a Municipal Commissioner in Bannu."" According to Captain J.A. Robinson (1930) he is the most efficient Chowdhri to the Corps"" he has known.

He was made Provincial Durbari and Honorary Magistrate in 1867-an honour bestowed for the first time on a Punjabi. S.

1446,KHAN BAHADUR HAJI AHMAD YAR KHAN KHOWGANI,"Divisional Darbari. Rais and Jagirdar, Multan, was born in 1862. He is one of the biggest landlords of the district and is held in universal esteem for his many eminent qualities of head and heart. He owns landed property, comprising nearly twenty thousand acres or forty thousand bighas, in the Multan, Lyallpur and Muzaffargarh districts and also house and other property worth two lakhs along with a Jagir of an annual income of Rs. 1,200. He is remarkably well- versed in Persian and Arabic. He is a worthy scion of a Khowgani Pathan family of venerable antiquity and of outstanding eminence in history. The first appearance of the family at Multan is associated with the advent of Humayun more than four centuries ago. Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa Khan, grand- father of the subject of this sketch, was in charge of Financial Department in the time of Dewan Sawan Mal and was Commander-in-Chief in the time of Dewan Mulraj. During the Multan trouble of 1848 he helped the British with personal services in the field and in various other ways. Col. Edwardes, who conquered Multan and later was in charge of the Multan Division, wrote about Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa's great services to the British at a critical time in the following enthusiastic terms:-""He was one of the ablest and most influential of the Multan Pathans who, at my bidding, separated them- selves from Dewan Mulraj in the rebellion of 1848 and joined my force. From June, 1848, till the operations against Multan ended Mustafa Khan served with me in co-operation with General Wish's Army, and so high was my opinion of him that I entrusted him with a detachment of 1,000 horse and foot and sent him to the relief of Jhang, 60 kos from my own headquarters. K.B Haji Ahmad Yar Khan Khowgani, Divisional Darbari, He also brought over many Multani Pathans from Rais and Jagirdar, Multan. Mulraj's side."" He added Ghulam Mustafa Khan never received regular pay from me during the war like other officers."" In the beginning of the Mutiny of 1857 Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa Khan raised, by order of the Commander-in-Ch a cavalry corps composed of members of his clan and at the head of it, under General Van Cortlandt, served in the field with marked distinction and success in the Bhuttee territory. On his return to the Punjab he tackled vigorously the insurgents in the Gugera district and succeeded before long in clearing the Bar or central forests. For these services he was rewarded with a Khil'at of Rs. 1,000, a sword and a pair of pistols. Subsequently, when the disarmed regiment broke out at Multan in 1858, he was sent by the Commissioner in pursuit of the mutineers with order to raise the peasantry. He executed these orders with tho- rough efficiency and success, and, after a desperate struggle on the part of the mutineers, utterly destroyed them. On this occasion he was awarded, on the recommendation of Sir John Lawrence, a Jagir of Rs. 1,000 per annum along with the title of Khan Bahadur. In addition to these rewards Khan Bahadur was granted lakhs of acres of land on perpetual lease. In all these great and invaluable services rendered by him to the British at a most critical period of their history in India, Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa Khan was ably and energetically assisted by his worthy son, Khan Bahadur Ghulam Qadir Khan, who also rendered various other valuable services on his own account. For these and many other honorary services voluntarily rendered to the Government and right out of the former grant to his father of lakhs of acres on perpetual lease. He was also the public Khan Bahadur Ghulam Qadir Khan was granted an area of 60,000 acres in proprietory awarded a Jagir of an annual income of Rs. 5,000 for two generations and the title of Khan second.

Besides 412 supplying about a hundred recruits, he contributed a handsome amount to the War Loan and sub- scribed liberally to different War Funds. He is always ready and glad to help the Administration in important matters whenever called for. His reputation for straightforwardness and honesty has travelled far beyond the confines of this Province-a fact which was strikingly illustrated in his being invited in January, 1921, by H. E. the Governor of Bombay to serve on a special Jirga to settle a long drawn-out dispute between the Magasis of Baluchistan and the Chandias of the Larkana district of Sind. That out of hosts of noblemen in our Province Khan Bahadur Haji Ahmad Yar Khan was selected for this high honour speaks volumes for his reputation, integrity and high character. As Mr. Abet, Commissioner of Multan, remarked in his letter dated the 28th June, 1920, inviting him to serve on that Jirga, the Jirga is an important one and it is a com- pliment to this Division that a resident of Multan has been selected to serve upon it."" The stupendousness of the task involved in this great undertaking on his part will be realised from the fact that as many as eight hundred and fifty cases had been pending for a long time in connection with that dispute. He was also invited by both the Governments of Bombay and the Punjab to take his place in another important Jirga in connection with the Drug Jaffar murder case in Balu- chistan. Almost solely through his tact and wisdom both these singularly difficult and compli- cated cases were decided to the entire satisfaction of the parties concerned, and for these happy results he received the heartiest congratulations of all concerned. In regard to the Chandia- Magassi dispute the Political Agent, Kalat, The Nawab came a long distance to do this service and as a member of this Jirga deserved great credit for the trouble he took in disposing of the whole of the case."" The District Magistrate of Larkana, in a memorandum dated July 7, 1921, conveyed to Khan Bahadur the thanks of H. E. the Governor-in-Council, Bombay, on account of valuable assistance rendered in connection with the special Shahi Chandia-Magassi Jirgah. In connection with this case it is remarkable that Khan Bahadur had proposed the expenses, amounting to Rs. 45,000, to be borne by the parties concerned and that the proposal was unhesitatingly accepted and the amount paid to Government. On another occasion the Frontier Administration at Loralai requisitioned the services of Khan Bahadur from the Punjab Government when a few persons of the Jaffar clan fled to foreign territory after killing three men and refused to return on threat or persuasion. It was solely through Khan Bahadur's matchless influence that they were ultimately arrested and suitably punished. For his numerous meritorious services both to the Government and the public as well as for his unique services in connection with the important Jirgahs mentioned above he was awarded the title of Khan Bahadur in 1925. The Khan Bahadur paid Rs. 500 to the Royal Silver Jubilee Fund in May, 1935, by way of example, as desired by the Deputy Commissioner, and Rs. 2,000 to the King Goorge Memorial Fund, also as example, according to the wish of His Excellency the Governor, Punjab. Khan Bahadur is blessed with four worthy sons. The eldest, Khan Faiz Mohammad Khan, has been Honorary Magistrate for thirteen long years. He has received certificates for his efficiency as a Magistrate and for his splendid services in connection with religious fairs and festivals as well as Moharrum riots. The second son, Khan Dost Mohammad Khan, is a member, District Board, and is rendering useful services in this capacity. He has received a number of certificates along with the prize of a watch for his services to the Police Department and a letter of thanks from H. the Governor for helping in the Quetta Relief Fund. The third son, Khan Ata Mohammad Khan, is assisting his father in the management of his vast estate. The fourth son, Khan Dur Mohammad Khan, is a nominated Municipal Commissioner and has had a distinguished career all through his life. He studied up to Diploma at Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore, win- ning the Rivaz Gold Medal meant for all-round good students, especially for his good character. The Principals in their certificates spoke highly of his character, influence and proficiency in sports. His shining character,"" wrote one of them, is what we shall miss most when he leaves. He is a real power to inspire others and carry them with him and he has used his influence, particularly in his last year, to the undoubted benefit of his colleagues and companions. He is a first-rate athlete and has been Captain of Cricket."" Another Principal remarked "" I do not think the College has ever turned out a better fellow."" He did splendid work as Municipal Commissioner for the success of the Royal Silver Jubilee celebrations, for which he received H. E. the Governor's certificate through the Deputy Commissioner. The family name, by the way, is wrongly given in English histories as Khakwani instead of Khowgani Durrani, as rightly given in the Sanad from the Mughal Darbar in regard to a grant of Muafi land in Sarai Saddu still preserved in the family.",U.

In this Sanad the owner of the Jagir is distinctly mentioned as Fateh Khan Durrani Khow- gani. This definitely contradicts and corrects the term Khukani or Khakwani which generally occurs in the accounts of the family in English histories and current official records. The family of Hafiz Habibullah Khan has ever been noted for its steadfast loyalty to the Crown. His grandfather, Hafiz Hakumat Khan, rendered cons- picuous services to Government in Sind during the Mutiny of 1857, while he was a prominent figure in the Mir's State in that province. He helped the benign Government in saving the Government Treasury when it was being removed from one place to another. His services in this respect were duly acknowledged by the Bombay Government through the Commissioner who sent to the Hafiz Sahib a Khillat of Rs. 300 with a certi- ficate through the Collector, Hyderabad (Sind). In the course of a certificate regarding his Mutiny services a high Khan Hafiz Habibullah Khan Khowgani, Rais, Landlord, and Divisional military officer wrote He assisted the Durbari, Multan, with his sons and grandsons. Biloch Battalion in every way during its progress from Hyderabad to Rossee in June, 1857, and the European officers of the Battalion are very much indebted to him for the handsome manner in which he provided for their comfort and attended to their wishes."" He also rendered equally conspicuous services during the Waziristan Expedition of 1860. He rendered those services at the express desire of the Commissioner, Leiah (then a Headquarter of the Commissionary, Punjab), who granted him a certificate in recognition of the same. He was Provincial Durbari and equally respected by the Government and the public. For his distinguished services he received a number of Sanads and certificates, was exempted by the Punjab Government from the operations of the Arms Act and was further allowed the privilege of retaining, along with ten attendants, seven guns, seven pistols, seven swords and seven spears. Hafiz Habibullah's father, Hafiz Mohammad Afzal Khan, also served the Government in various ways. He also was a Provincial Durbari and was universally respected for his many high qualities of head and heart. On the death of his father the privileges in regard to attendants and arms were transferred to him. Khan Hafiz Habibullah Khan Khowgani is in every respect an eminently worthy repre- sentative of his noble and illustrious family, having fully inherited all its distinctive virtues, particularly piety and theological learning, for which the family is famous. The term Hafiz, applied to its members, means one who has learnt the whole Holy Quran by heart. The privilege and honour of being called Hafiz belongs to the members of the family for six generations, namely, from Hafiz Fatch Khan Khowgani down to the sons of Hafiz Habibullah Khan Khowgani, the 414 subject of this sketch. Naturally on account of its spiritual eminence the family is universally respected. The senior branch of the family, settled at Dera Ismail Khan, enjoys the distinction of having produced men like Nawab Ata Mohammad Khan, an outstanding personality in his time with a unique his record of Mutiny and other political services to his credit. Nawab Ata Mohammad gave daughter in marriage to Hafiz Mohammad Afzal Khan thus the subject of this sketch is Nawab Ata Mohammad's daughter's son and son-in-law of the Nawab's real brother, Khan, real of the renowned Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa Khan, gave his daughter Khan Ghulam brother Mohammad Khan. Of the Multan branch of the family Khan Mohammad Amin in marriage to Hafiz Khan Hakumat Khan, grandfather of the subject of this sketch. On the occasion of the said marriage about 1,000 acres of land named Kassi Aminwah was given to Khan Hafiz Hakumat Khan on behalf of Khan Mohammad Amin Khan; 2,284 acres of land was given by K. B. Ghulam Qadar Khan, son of K. B. Ghulam Mustafa Khan, who was cousin and brother-in-law of Khan Mohammad Amin Khan's daughter. Khan Hafiz Habibullah Khan is universally respected for his high character and deep piety and is equally esteemed by the public and the Government for his selfless public spirit and sincere loyalty to the Crown. Though by nature, temperament and habit a spiritual recluse, scrupulously avoiding the limelight of publicity, he never hesitates to come out to help and serve the Government whenever an occasion arises for the same. During the Great War he filled his quota of recruitment as desired by the Commissioner of the Division. He celebrated the Royal Silver Jubilee in his village by sumptuously feeding the poor. He owns more than 3,000 bighas of land, paying about Rs. 7,000 as land revenue and water rate, and considerable house property. He is blessed with two worthy sons-Khan Hafiz Abdul Hasan and Khan Hafiz Lutfullah Khan. Both of them are assisting their father in the management of his estate. There are four grandsons-Khan Mohammad Aslam Khan, Khan Haqnawaz Khan, Khan Mohammad Moazam Khan, and Khan Mohammad Iqbal Khan.",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA

He owns four thousand and five hundred acres of land in the Multan district for which he has to pay about twelve thousand rupees as land revenue and water-rate. He is a worthy scion of the well-known Khowgani (wrongly inserted in previous English histories as Khakwani) family of Multan, whose loyal and faithful services to the British Crown have ever remained unparalleled in the south-west of the Province since the advent of the British Raj. A detailed history of the family is given in Sir Lepel Griffin's 'Chiefs and Families of Note,"" and also in the exhaustive life sketch of his uncle, Khan Bahadur Haji Ahmad Yar Khan Khowgani, published elsewhere in this book. Khan Abdul Ghafur Khan's great-grandfather and grandfather, Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Khan Bahadur Ghulam Qadir Khan, rendered unique services to the British during the Multan rebellion of 1848 and during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The subject of this sketch is the fourth son of Hafiz Khuda Bakhsh Khan Khowgani, who was the third son of the renowned Khan Bahadur Ghulam Qadir Khan. The late Hafiz Khuda Bakhsh Khan was the recipient of numerous certificates for assistance to Government officers and of a Sanad, a Khillat and many certificates for his splendid War services. Khan Abdul Ghafur Khan is equally respected by the Government and the public for his loyalty and public spirit.

An exhaustive account of the family is given in Sir Lepel Griffin's Chiefs and Families of Note."" In English histories the name of the family is wrongly given as Khakwani instead of Khowgani Durrani, as is clearly mentioned in a Sanad of Muafi land from the Moghal Durbar, still preserved in the family. Elphinston (Kabul ii. 99) speaks of Khowganies as a small clan living partly in Kandhar and partly mixed with the Nurzais ('Multan Gazetteer'). In 1888 Khan Mohammad Yar Khan, father of Khan Mushtaq Mohammad Khan, became Provincial Durbari and the recognised Sardar or Chief of the family. He helped the Administration in various ways and got Sanads and certificates. During the Great War he supplied a number of recruits and subscribed to different War funds. Khan Mohammad Yar Khan was on very bad terms with his younger brother, K. B. Haji Ahmed Yar Khan, who sued the Government for reparation in connection with the assumption of control over the Hajiwah Canal. Khan Mohammad Yar Khan sided with the Government in the protracted litigation. This opposition of K.B. Haji Ahmad Yar Khan greatly annoyed the Government and this was unfortunately mentioned by Government in both Sir Lepel Griffin's Late Khan Mohammad Yar Khan Khowgani, Jagirdar, History and the 'Punjab Gazetteer.'

Khan Mushtaq Mohammad Khan Khowgani was born in the year 1900 and educated in the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore. He is trying his best to fully maintain the high reputation of the family and tradition of steadfast loyalty so worthily created by his illustrious great grandfather, Khan Bahadur Haji Ghulam Mustafa Khan. During the Great War he offered his personal services, but owing to his tender age the Government was unable to give him a chance. He owns 28,000 Kanals of land and pays about Rs. 13,000 as land revenue and water rate. He also has house property of considerable value. The local authorities well appreciated his services during the past communal riots. On the occasion of Royal Silver Jubilee he played a prominent part in the celebrations and handsomely contributed to the Jubilee Fund, for which he received thanks from His Excellency the Governor and the Deputy Commissioner.

It is a large and flourishing family with its branches in different parts of the Punjab. The original ancestor of the Langriyals was Rai Wiram, a Chandra- bansi Rajput nobleman who lived and flourished in the hills in North Punjab. A prominent descendant of his, Yashuman Manzdaham, having a tender heart for the poor, made it the first duty of his life to maintain langars for them, and the family thus came to be popularly known as Langriyals. Yashuman embraced Islam, taking the name of Ghiyas-ud-Din, and was thus the founder of the Muslim branches of the Langriyals. Hindu Langriyals are mostly settled in the Gujrat and Sialkot districts of the Punjab and in the Jammu State. Sultan Amir, a descendant of Ghiyas-ud-Din, settled in Rawalpindi, where his descendants are still living. Some members of this family settled in Jhang and some others in Kamalia, now in the Lyallpur district, where their descendants have acquired much landed property. During the Sikh reign the Langriyals occupied an area of forty or fifty miles including extensive forests, along with Khushak Bias, and used to be called the Kings of Jungles. Malik Allah Bakhsh Langriyal was recognised by the Sikh rulers as a Sardar and was favoured with Jagirs. On the advent of the British in 1849, Malik Machiya Langriyal, grandfather of the subject of this sketch and recognised in his time as head of the family and Sardars, was honoured by the new Government with the recognition of all his dignities and rights. Malik Machiya rendered meritorious services to the British during the Mutiny of 1857, especially in connection with the insurrections in the Gogaira territory. In recognition of the same he was awarded a Jagir along with a great tract of Government waste land as well as a Sanad, certificate and a Khillat of Rs. 225 from His Excellency the Viceroy through His Honour the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab. He was also made Provincial Durbari. He served the Government in various ways during the Kabul Expedition of 1879, himself proceeding to the front with forty-two camel- drivers. He further greatly assisted the Government during the Egyptian campaign of 1885 and furnished as many as sixty-eight camel-drivers. He received certificates from Government in appreciation of these services. All through his life he continued to be immensely helpful to Government in various ways. In 1888 he was invited by Mr. C.H.T. Marshal to send the full history of his family for insertion in Sir Lepel Griffin's 'Chiefs and Families of Note in the Punjab."" But he did not care. He died in 1904, deeply mourned by his many friends and admirers. His son, Malik Bahadur Khan, father of the subject of this sketch, was widely respected for his noble and generous nature.

1486,KHAN MOHAMMAD IHSAN ALI KHAN,"Provincial Durbari, who is prominent among the Khawanins of Malerkotla, was born in 1890 and educated at Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore. He belongs to the Ruling Family of Malerkotla, being descended from Nawab Jamal Khan. His grandfather, Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan, was the grandson of Nawab Bahadur Khan, son of Nawab Jamal Khan. Nawab Bahadur Khan, who died in 1866, was himself a Ruling Chief. Khan Hassan Ali Khan, Malerkotla. Khan Mohammad Ihsan Ali Khan, Malerkotla. Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan exercised judicial powers in his Jagir and was a prominent figure in his time in Malerkotla. He was entitled to the Gaddi after the death of Nawab Sikandar Ali Khan, who had no son, but owing to some unpleasantness his claims were disregarded and Nawab Mohammad Ibrahim Ali Khan was adopted by Nawab Sikandar Ali Khan as heir and successor. Consequently on the death of Nawab Sikandar Ali Khan Nawab Mohammad Ibrahim Ali Khan was invested with ruling powers. It is clear from the above fact that if the succession to the Gaddi had followed from the senior line Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan would have been the Ruler of Malerkotla and thus the position of Khan Mohammad Ihsan Ali Khan, who is the son of Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan's eldest son, would have been to-day different from what it is. In spite of the new turn of events the rights of the sons of Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan could not be ignored, and the Government had to recognise their distinctive position in the State. Thus Khan Mohammad Ihsan Ali Khan is in undisputed enjoyment of certain rights and privileges in common with the State and he contributes one-tenth of his income towards the maintenance of the Imperial Service Sappers. Out of the three Khawanins-sons of Khan Ghulam Mohammad Khan-Sir Zulfikar Ali Khan, KT., C.S.I., and his nephew, Khan Mohammad Ihsan Ali Khan, owing to some un- pleasantness with the State, permanently transferred their residences to Lahore and Ludhiana respectively. During the Great War Khan Mohammad Ihsan Ali Khan contributed about Rs. 25,000 to different War Funds, besides his usual contribution of one-tenth of his income towards the maintenance of the Imperial Service Sappers. His two uncles also rendered various services. Khan Mohammad Ihsan Ali Khan is very popular among the notables of Ludhiana, both official and non-official.

His purse was always open to every fund for public was good, whether raised by the Government or the public. He was the only member of the family who performed Haj. Unfortunately in his old age he received an unbearable shock by the death of his only surviving son, Nawabzada Khurshed Ali Khan, in the very prime of his youth at the age of leaving behind his only son, Nawabzada Mohammad Zulfiqar Ali Khan, the subject of this sketch, 20, who was then a baby of not more than a year. Khan Bahadur Nawab Haji Shamsher Ali Khan died in 1908, and as his grandson, viz., the aforesaid baby, was a minor, his estate was taken under the superintendence of the Court of Wards. Nawabzada Mohammad Zulfiqar Ali Khan was educated at the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore, up to the Diploma Standard. He is well versed in Urdu, English and Persian. The annual income from all sources of his big estate is about Rs. 50,000 including the Jagir income of about Rs. 20,000. He was released from the Court of Wards in 1924 on attaining majority. Since then he has been trying his best to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather by serving the Government and the public alike with equal energy and devotion. He has inherited in full all the noble virtues of his illustrious grandfather. He gave more than Rs. 10,000 as subscriptions to all public and Government utility work throughout the Province. Every fund of public utility can count upon his ready support and spontaneous liberality. The list of his own and family subscriptions is long enough for the proverbial philanthropy of his historic house. A hall in the Edward Memorial Hospital of Karnal, erected by him and bearing his name, is a living testimony of the Nawabzada's generosity. During the Great War, 1914-18, the Nawabzada, being a minor, could not keep up the family traditions by helping the benign Government personally, yet his estate was not behind any other estate in its services to the Empire. It subscribed about Rs. 60,000 to the War Loans and contributed about Rs. 6,000 to the different War Funds. He encouraged his tenants to enlist in the Army. His public activities embrace a wide range of usefulness. He worked devotedly for several years as an elected Member of the Karnal Municipal Committee and as a nominated Member of the District Board. He has been working as non-official Visitor of the Karnal Sub-Jail since 1924 and as Honorary Sub-Registrar since 1927 and now he has been appointed Honorary Magistrate. He is Life Member of Red Cross Society; Hony. Treasurer of the Red Cross Society and the Prisoners' Aid Society; Hony. Secretary to the Red Cross Library, Karnal; a member of the Executive Committee of the Provincial Prisoners' Aid Society; a Life Member of the Fruit Growers' Association of the Province; Member, Fauna Committee, and President, Jacob's Club, Karnal. He was also President of the Anjuman Islamia, Karnal, for a considerable time. He received several letters of thanks from the authorities for the support and help rendered by him at critical junctures such as the Panipat disturbances, flood relief work, etc., besides in the general administration of the District. He received several Government Sanads for public utility works such as Red Cross, St. John Ambulance, Prisoners' Aid. His name was specially mentioned by the Inspector-General of Hospitals, Punjab, in his annual report for the year 1926 for his taking keen interest in Hospital affairs. On His Excellency the Viceroy's visit to Karnal in 1926 he was the only prominent member of the aristocracy of the District to have been selected for the high honour of entertaining His Excellency the Viceroy at some function. He had thus had the rare privilege of having His Excellency the Viceroy as his guest at a display of fireworks at Karnal Tank specially arranged in His Excellency's honour, for which he received His Excellency's thanks and appreciation. A unique honour like this is not known to have fallen to the lot of any- one else in the district within living memory. All these many-sided activities bear eloquent testimony to the energy and devotion with which the Nawabzada applies himself to all affairs of public good. He has also been, during all his life, an ardent lover of many sports and takes keen interest in the local athletic games. In his College days he was a Member of the Chiefs' College Cricket and Hockey XI and Cadet Corps. The Nawabzada carries a singularly wise head upon his young shoulders, as is evident to any one who comes in contact with him. He enjoys the esteem and affection of all the officials as well as of all classes of people, irrespective of race and creed, for his noble birth, high character, intensely generous nature, earnest public spirit, genial temperament and innate nobility of soul.

Chaudhri Ram Krishen is the only son of Chaudhri Erupat. Chaudhri Ram Krishen's father had a liking for Zamindari in preference to all other callings and occupations. He brought up his son in accordance with his own ideal and his labours would appear from results to have hardly gone in vain.

His intervention at a critical stage resulted in the withdrawal of the opposition by the Hindu-Muslim Panchayat after which large outstanding amounts of the obnoxious tax were recovered with little difficulty. Chaudhri Ram Krishen deserves a consideration of local officers for these services and I hope they will be suitably rewarded in due course.""

1568,MIAN SHAHBAZ-UD-DIN,"Jagirdar, Assessor, Juror, Silver Jubilee Medalist, a landlord and Durbari, Lahore, comes of a respectable family of Sindhu Jats which migrated to Lahore from Khawaspura in Amritsar District (Punjab). His father, Mian Qamar-ud-Din, was an officer in the North-Western Railway. Born in the last decade of the nineteenth century Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din combines in himself the patience of a conservative and the zeal of a twentieth century liberal. Around him there was much talk of revolutionary upheavals, but he was taught to appreciate the merits of orderly progress. So we have always found Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din throw- ing his weight on the side of law and order, which he has always done with a conviction. It is his belief that he can best serve his motherland by helping the British administration which is run in the interest of the Indian people. On several occasions he has shown unswerving fidelity to the cause of Government in the teeth of strong opposition on the part of the people among whom he has to work. But intimidation and opposition can never make him change his creed. At one time, when intensive and subversive activities of the Congress assumed formidable proportions in Lahore, Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din worked day and night to undo the influence of its sinister propaganda. By way of retaliation they organised a syapa"" (mourning) against him in front of his house. Upon this the Deputy Commissioner of Lahore wrote to Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din that he very much appreciated his services and knew that he had incurred great odium of the people on account of his loyalty to Government. His record of public service is such that he can legitimately feel proud of it. He has given proof of Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din, Jagirdar, Assessor, Juror, Lahore. personal gallantry by attending meetings convened by the most unruly section of the people. Not only this but he has on several occasions remonstrated with crowds bent upon rioting and creating disturbances. Many a critical situation has been brought under control by his unfailing tact. For instance, we refer to an incident reported in the 'Hindustan Times dated 11th March, 1928, under the heading, ""Serious Development Averted,"" as follows:- A very peculiar incident is reported to have occurred yesterday when a procession passed through Dabbi Bazar to Rang Mahal. It is said that some photographers commenced photographing ladies in the proccession, a behaviour which was seriously resented by Sikhs. Through the best efforts of Mr. Shahbaz-ud-Din, Special Juror of the City, who took the film in his custody, the situation was brought under control."" This shows the high regard in which he is held by the public. The Government has, from time to time, recognised his services by awarding golden Sanads and numerous commendation certificates. In 1931 a Jagir was conferred on him. Then the Government presented a revolver to him. On the occasion of the celebration of Silver Jubilee of His late Majesty King George he was awarded a Silver Jubilee Medal. As a citizen of Lahore he has been honoured with a seat in Durbar and is a Special Juror and Assessor. His singular spirit of loyalty to the Crown could not have been more strikingly illustrated than on the occasion of the Royal Silver Jubilee. The manner in which he celebrated that happy occasion constitutes a record of devotion and large-heartedness to which there is no parallel. An outstanding fact in that connection, so characteristic of Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din, was to show his first consideration for the poor. Through advertisements in newspapers and flaring posters at every prominent place in the city he invited the poor of Lahore, one and all, irrespective of race and creed, to a free and hearty feast at his residence. The poor came in their hundreds and had the happiest entertainment of their lives. Among those who have been coming into personal contact with him from time to time. and have expressed their appreciation of the services of Mian Shahbaz-ud-Din may be mentioned personages like H. E. Sir William Malcolm Hailey, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., I.C.S., H. E. Sir Geoffrey Fitzharvey de Montmorency, K.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., C.B.E., I.C.S., Sir Henry Craik Bart, K.C.S.I., His Excellency Sir Herbert William Emerson, K.C.S.I., C.I.E., C.B.E., I.C.S., Governor of the Punjab, the Hon.

1570,RAI SAHIB SHIB SEHAI,"retired Personal Assistant to the Inspector-General, R.M.S., Northern Circle. President, Kayastha Sabha, Ambala Cantonment, was born on March 4, 1860. He is a worthy scion of an old and distinguished family. His fore- fathers held responsible positions under the Moghal Raj and also served the Government under the East Indian Company. His family rendered Subedar Shahbaz Khan, valuable services to the Crown during the Mutiny for which his grandfather- Jandola, Distt. D. I. Khan. in-law, Baboo Shiv Dyal Singh, was made Deputy Collector of Panipat. He is a profound scholar in Persian, Arabic, Urdu and English and is intensely religious- minded. In recognition of his religious activities and spiritual eminence Sri Bharat Dharma Mahamandal of Benares has conferred on him the title of Dharam Bhushan. Rai Sahib retired from Government service on 1st April, 1918, after forty long years' meritorious service. During his long and distin- guished career he was deputed to the following expeditions, campaigns and Durbars and was awarded four medals :-Kabul War 1879-80, Miranzai Expedition, Hazara Field Force, Chitral Relief Force, Tirah Campaign and Delhi Durbars 1902 and 1911. His name was more than once mentioned in Government Despatches for good work. It is a remarkable fact that during his long service he never availed himself of even a single day's leave of absence. Mr. C. C. Sheridan, Inspector- General, R.M.S., always spoke highly of his work. He was awarded the title of Rai Sahib in 1911. On the occasion of handing over the Sanad Rai Sahib Shib Sehai. of Rai Sahib to him before a large gathering at Ambala Cantonment, Sir Charles Stewart-Wilson, Director-General of Post Office, paid a glowing tribute to his honesty, loyalty, industry and intellect. During the Great War Rai Sahib served the Empire in various ways and subscribed liberally to different War Funds. His heart literally bleeds for the poor. He is founder of the 'Poor Boys' Education Fund.' Mounting to about Rupees 25,000 in gratuities and other scholar- ships, his charity includes numerous gratuities to widows and ceaseless alms-giving to the poor and the needy. He is compiler of 'Rohtagi Bhatnagar Geneological Table'. During the Civil Disobedience movement and on various other occasions he distributed pamphlets and leaflets annually inculcat- ing loyalty to the Crown. Copies of these were acknowledged with thanks by His Excellency the Viceroy and all high officials.

1572,SETH SHIV NARAYAN,"Divisional Treasurer, Honorary Magistrate, Millowner, Banker, Proprietor of the firm of Seth Harbhagat Rai Gopal Sahai, Multan, was born at Rewari, District Gurgaon, on the 11th December, 1897. He is a worthy scion of the oldest, the most respectable and the wealthiest family of Rewari, well known for their services for generations to the States of Marwar and to the British Government as Treasurers and in various other responsible capacities. In 1868 Seth Shiv Narayan's grandfather, Seth Saligram, Municipal Vice-President, Rewari, was appointed Divisional Treasurer, Multan, in recognition of his public services and services to Government. The family has since been living at Multan. Seth Saligram filled this responsible post with honour and distinction for thirty long years and on his retirement, in recognition of his distinguished service, the post was given to his worthy son Rai Sahib Seth Gopal Sahai. Rai Sahib also, like his father, held this post for thirty long years and, as the numerous certificates of high officers show, with credit to himself. He also served as Late Rai Sahib Seth Gopal Sahai, Divisional Treasurer, Honorary Magistrate, Millowner, Banker, Multan. Seth Shiv Narayan, Divisional Treasurer, Honorary Magistrate, Millowner, Banker, Multan. Honorary Magistrate with marked ability for as long as twenty years and his 'good work"" in that capacity was prominently mentioned by Mr. V. Connolly, Commissioner, Multan, and various other high officers in their certificates to Rai Sahib. He was held in the highest esteem by the public and the officials alike for his earnest public spirit and sincere loyalty to the Government of which he never lost an opportunity of giving a practical demonstration to the fullest extent of his capacity and means. The measure of his popularity with the officials will be gauged from the following significant words occurring in the certificate of Mr. J.S. Thomson, Deputy Commissioner, Multan, in 1928 Seth Gopal Sahai has SO many commendations that mine is scarcely neces- sary."" During the Great War he supplied recruits and subscribed liberally to various War Funds. He received a Sanad from the Provincial War Loan Committee, Punjab Government's Sanad for services during the Mohurrum riots in 1922 and another Punjab Government Sanad on behalf of His Majesty for his good work as Honorary Magistrate. He was remarkably dutiful. Associated as he was with all the local institutes in one way or another, he never failed to discharge the duties entrusted to him by all these bodies with commendable promptitude and thoroughness in spite of his numerous other engagements. Generous by nature, his purse was always open to all funds for public good, whether started by the Government or the public. He contributed liberally to all famine, flood and earthquake funds. Though a big Rais and a high and responsible official, he was not only free from the least trace of pride but was of an adorably social and genial tempera- ment. He was easily accessible to one and all, even the lowliest. He was SO tender-hearted that he would on no account hurt the feelings of a supplicant by a denial. His services were available for all the twenty-four hours to one and all, from child to old man. He was intensely religious- minded and, though orthodox in his principles, was admirably free from religious bias. In recog- nition of his high character, efficient discharge of duties as Divisional Treasurer and Honorary Magistrate, and multifarious services to Government and the public he was awarded the title of Rai Sahib in 1928. He retired on pension in 1926 and died in 1935 at Rewari, only after a few days' illness, at the age of seventy, deeply mourned by his numerous friends and admirers at Multan and Rewari. After Rai Sahib's retirement from service in 1926 the tradition in his own case in regard to Divisional Treasurership of Multan repeated itself in case of his own son, Seth Shiv Narayan, who was appointed to this high and responsible post as a mark of appreciation of his father's distinguished service. He served the benign Government as Treasurer and in various other capa- cities for about ten years in the lifetime of his father, receiving a lot of certificates from high officers. Mr. A. V. Askwith, Deputy Commissioner, wrote in the course of a certificate to Rai Sahib Gopal Sahai on January 12, 1931 I need only say that I always felt that I could place absolute reliance both on you and Seth Shiv Narayan. Both of you were ever ready to give me and the other officers of Government all possible assistance."" As Divisional Treasurer, as in many other capacities, he has proved an eminently worthy son of his illustrious father. In the glowing certificate of Mr. Thomson, Deputy Commissioner, it is rightly considered sufficient praise "" that he is a satisfactory successor' to Rai Sahib Gopal Sahai. His certificates amply testify to his many good and noble qualities and his creditable record of never-failing assistance to the Administration on all needful occasions. The Inspector-General of Police in his certificate highly praises him for the assistance he rendered in recovering the dead body of a Hindu child that had been mur- dered by a domestic servant, but which affair had been given a communal colour. He also received two certificates for his valuable services during Moharrum festivals. He is actively associated with all local institutes in one way or another and is quite as dutiful and generous as his late father in regard to all movements and funds for public good. In recognition of his high abilities and meritorious services to the public and the Government he was made Honorary Magis- trate in 1933. With all his multifarious duties in official and public capacities he is intensely devoted to business. Under the guidance of his gifted brain and laudable energy his business in all its different departments is flourishing all along the line. He pays every year thousands of rupees as Income- tax. He was awarded the Royal Silver Medal for commendable Jubilee services. He is blessed with two promising sons-Ramnarain and Badrinarain-aged 10 and 8 respectively.",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA

1576,BHAI FATEH JANG SINGH,"Rais of Sidhowal in the District of Karnal, is a worthy B scion of the sacred family of Bhaikan. The family of Bhaikan is sanctified by its associa- tion with the fourth and fifth Gurus, and the royal family of Phulkian Chiefs. The ancestors of both these great families came from Jaisalmir in Rajputana and founded Hissar and Bhatinda. The descendants of one of them, Choudhri Dahar, came to constitute the holy family of Bhaikan and those of another, Choudhri Bhoor, the royal family of Phulkian. A descendant of Choudhri Dahar, Chou- dhri Nanak Chand, an outstanding person- ality in his time, colonised Mouza Bholeer and settled there. After his death his son, Choudhri Aum, having no issue, went to Guru Ram Das at Amritsar and, after ren- dering to him various services, prayed to him for a son. By the blessing of the Guru he had in due course a son whom, by the wish of the Guru, he named Bhagtoo. Accor- ding to the prediction of the Guru, Bhagtoo showed signs of a great Bhagat from his infancy and performed miracles from the age of ten. On his being presented by his father to Guru Arjan, the Guru said that since Bhagtoo was born by the blessing of his father he would call him ""Bhai."" The houses of Sidhowal and Arnauli, claiming direct descent from Bhai Bhagtoo, have since been called Bhaika and the Gov- ernment also addresses the heads of these houses as ""Bhai."" Bhai Bhagtoo had two sons-Bhai Jiwan and Bhai Goura. Jiwan died at the age of seventeen, leaving a son, Sant Das, whose descendants are known as Chakwalas and Jhandwalas. Bhai Goura, a worthy succes- sor to his illustrious father, was renowned for prowess and piety. He could not bear the country around him being laid waste by excesses of Moghul officers. To protect the sufferers as well as his own people he collect- ed troops and strengthened the Fort of Bhatinda and thus became a power in the land. The garden-house and the Diwan- khana of Bhai Goura still exist. Of Bhai Goura's four sons the eldest, Bhai Dyal Singh, was as able as he was pious. He colonised Bhochuki and various other places, but in his later life he immersed himself in devotional exercises and paid little attention Bhai Fateh Jang Singh, Rais, Sidhowal, District Karnal. to worldly affairs. Bhai Dyal Singh's son, Bhai Gurbaksh Singh, made his mark in the history of his time by his intellect, enterprise and nobility of soul. Being a great warrior, he made many conquests along with his inseparable friend, Raja Ala Singh. With characteristic generosity he presented Fort Sunam, one of his precious possessions won by sword, to Rani Fatto as a gift for Tiyan festival. In this connection he once went to Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan, Governor at Sirhind, against the warning of Bhai Gurbaksh Singh. The Governor kept him in confinement at the instigation of Bahakkaf Khan Afghan of Kotla. Hearing of this, Bhai Gurbaksh Singh, who was camping at Mouza Laungowal with his troops, rushed to his rescue and, securing his release by force with the help of only four troopers, returned to Laungowal. The Governor sent troops in pursuit. Bhai Gurbaksh Singh met them near Mouza Sheron and completely routed them. Suspecting Diwan Lachhmi Narain of Chakla Sirhind of conspiracy with the Governor, Raja Ala Singh wanted to kill him, but, with characteristic magnanimity, Bhai Gurbaksh Singh saved his life. The Diwan accordingly called him Jan Baksh. In the unsettled state of the country following the excesses of Ahmad Shah Durrani, Bhai Gurbaksh Singh, Raja Ala Singh and other Sardars made many conquests and divided the territory among themselves. Bhai Gurbaksh Singh died in 1817 Bikrami, leaving six sons of whom the eldest, Bhai Bodh Singh, and the fourth, Bhai Desu Singh, were as brave as they were enterprising. Bhai Bodh Singh, with the help of his brothers, conquered Kasba Badlada, the Parganah and the town of Thaneswar, Azamabad and various other tracts and Ilaqas. Bhai Bodh Singh dying issueless, Bhai Desu Singh took possession of his territory and, with the help of his sword, added further to his own. Bhai Desu Singh died leaving two sons-Bahal Singh and Lal Singh. Bhai Bahal Singh was renowned for reckless bravery, which has since passed into a proverb. He died issueless, the leaving Bhai Lal Singh, great-grandfather of Bhai Fateh Jang Singh, as sole successor to Estate. Taking advantage of Bhai Lal Singh's minority some Sikh adventurers seized his territory and, finding Raja Sahib Singh of Patiala not sufficiently wideawake, conquered and took posses- sion of several other Ilaqas. Not very long after Bhai Lal Singh rose to eminence by sheer force of character, intellect, bravery and enterprise. Winning over to his side Kunjdhar Rao Marhatta, representative of the Peshwa at Panipat, he got Thaneswar released from the clutches of the adventurers and soon after completely broke the power of the latter with the aid of his own arms. In due course Bhai Lal Singh grew into a military power to be reckoned with, so much so that when George Thomas attacked Jind, the Chief of that State sought his help against that dreaded adventurer. On that occasion as well as on several other occasions later on Bhai Lal Singh got the better of George Thomas in many a pitched battle. When Jaswant Rao Holkar and Eka Rao Pandit came devastating the country between the Jamna and the Ganges, General Ochterlony entrusted Bhai Lal Singh and Raja Bhag Singh with the stupendous task of protecting the same. Pitched against such powerful enemies, Bhai Lal Singh gave a marvellously Rao creditable account of himself. He harassed Jaswant Rao to distraction, and, defeating Eka in open battle, seized and killed him and sent his head to General Ochterlony, who wrote to him a letter expressing pleasure and appreciation. Lord Lake also wrote to him in the following enthusiastic terms : Your kind letter has afforded everlasting happiness in intimating that you have punished and destroyed Eka Rao Pandit, the adherent of Jaswant Rao Holkar, who was a pest of the country, and that you have plundered that unthinking wretch, and have ruined his men. The bravery manifested by you and your brave sepoys is like that of Rustam, and has afforded great gratification. You only were equal to this business. The brave always behave so. Everybody, high and low, always and everywhere, applauds your gallant deeds. Thanks to God that such an achievement has been attained through the force of your arms. It was equal to the fight of Rustam and Isfandyar."" When Jaswant Rao Holkar marched to Amritsar with a view to securing the alliance of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Bhai Lal Singh, with Raja Bhag Singh, accompanied Colonel Barry in pursuit. It was ultimately Bhai Lal Singh's diplomatic mission to Maharaja Ranjit Singh, through his able agent, Chet Ram, that prevented Jaswant Rao Holkar from succeeding in his move. For this invaluable service at a critical moment Bhai Lal Singh received from great Government Parganah Hansi and Parganah Mandwati. A notable trait of Bhai Lal Singh's character was inability to bear injustice to any one, no matter to whatever race or creed he or she might belong. Here is a noteworthy instance in point. When he was at the zenith of his the Afghan Ruler of Kotla, Ahmad Alias, died, leaving behind a minor son. The rule Sahib of power the Regent, one Roshan Gujjar, soon developed into one of unbroken zoolum, and Bedi not bear this and tried his level best, by peaceful means, to bring the offenders to his senses.

In recognition of these he was sepoys granted a Sanad reducing the commutation from two annas to one anna per rupee perma- nently and a Khillat for his loyalty to the Paramount Power. 477 Bhai Fateh Jang Singh is in every way an eminently worthy representative of this historic family and always tries, in his dealings with the world, to move in the footsteps of his illustrious forefathers.

The moral and material well-being of his ryots is always his first consideration. He has done a lot of reforms in his Estate for the education and uplift of his ryots by whom he is literally and deservedly adored. In his dealings with the world Bhai Fateh Jang Singh is ideally fair and honest. In private life he is a model of a gentleman. Every one who comes in contact with him is charmed by his courteous behaviour and suavity of manners as well as by his manly bearing. He is of an intensely charitable disposition. As was to be expected, his munificence is not without its saving grace of modesty. The traditions of the family for loyalty to Government on the one hand and earnest and selfless public spirit on the other have been thoroughly maintained by Bhai Fateh Jang Singh. He helps the Administration in every way. On the other hand every movement aiming at public good can count upon his ready and hearty support. Bhai Fateh Jang Singh is a very keen sportsman.

Thompson, Commissioner, Multan Division, describing Sardar Ghulam Hussain as a well-educated young man, observes When recruiting for the special companies of South- Eastern Punjab Mussalmans began, he was one of the first to come forward and enlist as a sepoy.

He is a resident of Chak Sardar Ganda Singh, Tahsil Dipalpur, District Montgomery, holding substantial landed property in the Multan and Montgomery districts, Punjab, and at Nawabshah, Sind.

After the fall of the Sikh Empire he retired to his village home and, on the invitation of the British, rendered signal services in the Rajputana Field Force under Major-General Honner against Tantia Topi, one of the leaders of the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The following few lines regarding him from the autobiography of General Sir O'Moore Creagh, V.C., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., are worth quoting During the early years of Milkha Singh's service (under Maharaja Ranjit Singh) his Regiment was engaged in many victorious battles in the long war with the Afghans, and when war with the British broke out it fought on the losing side, suffering defeat at Mudki, Ferozeshah and Subraon.

1604,SYED ZAFAR HASAN ABBASI,"Chief Representative, Imperial Publishing Company, Lahore, was born in 1298 Hijri. He is a worthy scion of the well-known Abbasi Syed family of Rahon in the District of Jullundur. The Abbasis are direct descendants of Hazrat Abbas, the Prophet's uncle. This great old family is respected everywhere. Syed Zafar Hasan Abbasi's great-great-grandfather, Hazrat Syed Lutfullah Shah Abbasi, was a great Saint of his time. His pious habits and the miracles he performed for the good of humanity brought in large number of disciples around him. His shrine lies in Qazian Street, Rahon, where his Urs is celebrated annually and which is still considered a place for taking blessings. His only son, Syed Qalandar Ali Shah Abbasi, held the high and respon- sible post of Dewan of the Jhajjar State, at that time one of the leading States of India. His only son, Syed Wajih Ahmad Abbasi, who took his education with the Princes, turned out a renowned scholar of Oriental languages in very early youth, SO much SO that, on the death of his father, the Nawab was pleased to take him, then only fifteen years of age, as Dewan in his father's place. But his elder sister would not have her minor brother remain SO far off from home and suffered full two months' cart journey to bring him home. Here in the Punjab Syed Wajih Ahmad joined the Police Force and served the Government creditably, especially in the dark days of the Mutiny while in Kotwali at Ludhiana. After retirement he took leave of worldly affairs in the truest sense of the term, passing the remaining thirty long years of his life in a mosque, praying and teaching. He departed from this world in 1901, leaving behind two sons. The elder, Syed Mohammad Husain Abbasi, Deputy Inspector of Police, died in 1911. As a Police officer he was a model of straightforwardness and Syed Zafar Hasan Abbasi, Chief Representative, scrupulous honesty. Of his four sons, the third, Dr. Syed Imperial Publishing Company, Lahore. Mohammad Rashid, has become very popular both as Physician and Surgeon. He is at present serving in the Jullundur City Civil Hospital. Syed Mohammad Hasan Abbasi, the second son of Syed Wajih Ahmad Abbasi, was an uncommonly intelligent, enlightened and painstaking nobleman and served well his kinsmen. He died in May, 1926, leaving behind two sons (three other sons having predeceased him). The eldest, Syed Mohammad Mohsin Abbasi, P.E.S., served in the Education Department very creditably for thirty-five years in different capacities. Every officer, who came in contact with him, spoke warmly of his keen intelligence and high abilities. He retired on pension in 1930 and has since been living a pious life at home in Rahon. He is blessed with two sons-Syed Mohammad Ahsan Abbasi and Syed Mohammad Abbasi. Syed Zafar Hasan Abbasi is the youngest son of Syed Mohammad Hasan Abbasi. He was enlisted in the Police Force in 1898, but after only a year he resigned and joined the Audit Office, N.-W. Ry., Lahore. He served this Department with distinction for more than ten years and became Head Clerk of the Ticket-printing Section. In 1911, just before the Coronation Durbar, he joined the Imperial Publishing Company, Lahore, as Sub-Agent to Mr. Morris for bringing out the Company's monumental illustrated publication The Imperial Coronation Durbar, 1911."" In regard to this work and the next great publications India and the War,"" etc., he gained exceptional distinction among his co-workers and thus rose gradually to his present position. His success in the very beginning of his career was to no small extent due to the affectionate patronage of the late renowned Hakim Ajmal Khan, the leader of All-India fame, who not only helped him to secure business from the notables of Delhi but also introduced him in certain leading Indian States. Mr. Abbasi's twenty-seven years' long experience, as well as honest and efficient work in this line, has made him popular far and near. He also made his name as Sole Agent for several years of the paintings of Mr. Nazir Husain of Delhi, an artist of international reputation. He has also been connected for the last nine years with the Prudential Assurance Co., Ltd., London,-the greatest Assurance Company of the British Empire. In this line too he has demonstrated his canvassing capacity by securing policies worth lakhs. Mr. Abbasi was the first member of the family to turn from Government service to business, and his success in this line has induced some other members of the family to follow in his footsteps. For instance, his first cousin, Dr. M. S. Muttaqi, has given a lead to the Muslim com- munity in the Insurance line by starting The Muslim India Insurance Company' in Lahore and, as its Founder Managing Director, has been giving a creditable account of himself. In August, 1935, Mr. Abbasi, received an unbearable shock in the passing away of his only son, Syed Faiz Hasan Abbasi, a promising boy of about ten. He has now two daughters.",U. P. & AJMER-MERWARA
