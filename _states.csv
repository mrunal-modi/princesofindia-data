0,Hyderabad (Deccan),"HYDERABAD (Deccan) STATE, is 82,698 square miles in area with a population of 14,436,148 souls and an average annual revenue of Rs. 1,98,90,000. The present Ruler, His Exalted Highness Nawab Mir Sir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur, G.C.S.I., G.B.E., was born in 1886 and succeeded to the gaddi in 1911. He is the Premier Prince of India. His Exalted Highness is the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad and a lineal descendant of the founder of the family, the first Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah, who was Viceroy of the Deccan under the Moghuls and for a time Chief Minister of the Moghul Empire. The family of the Nizam is one of the most ancient and illustrious in India, tracing its descent from the Khalifa Abu Bakr, who succeeded the Prophet as the spiritual and temporal head of Islam. The loyalty of the Royal House of Hyderabad to the British Crown has been strikingly demonstrated on every suitable occasion ever since the advent of the British in India. During the Franco-British struggle in India toward's the middle of the eighteenth century the Nizam sided with the British. During the dark days of the Mutiny His Exalted Highness's great-grandfather was not an insignificant factor in the success of the British arms, and the importance of his help may be realized from the Governor of Bombay's famous message to the Resident of Hyderabad If the Nizam goes, all is lost."" On his death-bed he advised his successor to continue to be faithful to the English as the English had always been friendly to the rulers of Hyderabad. This advice, persistently impressed upon him during his long minority by Sir Salar Jung, was followed with scrupulous fidelity by His Exalted Highness's illustrious father, His late Highness Mir Mahbub Ali Khan Bahadur Fateh Jung Nizam-ud-Dowla Nizam-ul-Mulk, throughout his brilliant and beneficent rule. In 1885 he offered his troops for the Egyptian campaign and two years later offered sixty lakhs of rupees towards the defence of the North-West Frontier against a possible Russian invasion, offering even to take the field in person in the event of war. The number of important reforms and improvements initiated in the State by His Exalted Highness, or carried out under his guidance, is remarkable for the brief period of three years intervening between his accession and the Great War, which had the effect of retarding some more ambitious of them by its enormous and continued demand on the revenues of the State. In memory of the devastating floods of 1908, one of the first acts of His Exalted Highness on his accession was to cause a dam to be built across the river Musi on which the city of Hyderabad is situated, followed by water-works conducting pure drinking water to the city in a large conduit from a distance of ten miles. Another dam across the river Isi has also been constructed. Many parts of the country have been opened up by roads, water-works have been established at some Provincial towns and many hospitals and jails constructed in districts remote from the Capital. Not the least important of the reforms and improvements introduced in the State by His Exalted Highness is the increasing provision for the education of his people. The budget of the Education Department has more than trebled. The number of schools has also undergone a corresponding increase, SO that there is hardly a village of any importance now without its school. But the most notable educational experiment is no doubt the institution at Hyderabad of the Osmania University. Hitherto higher education in India had been imparted through the medium of English. The new University represents the first attempt of its kind to impart higher instruction through the student's own vernacular, Urdu, and to teach English merely as a language. His Exalted Highness the Nizam, with most of the principal nobles and officials of the State, attended the Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1911. Two squadrons of the Hyderabad Imperial Service Lancers also proceeded to Delhi where they took part in the Review. His Exalted Highness contributed Rs. 1,53,00,000 towards the maintenance of the Hyderabad Imperial Lancers and the 20th Deccan (now the Royal) Horse on active service throughout the Great War. He also subscribed Rs. 6,39,000 to various relief funds in addition to donations to His Majesty's Government and to objects in England connected with the War amounting to Â£225,800. The Hyderabad Government subscribed Rs. 1,64,00,000 to the War Loans. One lakh of rupees was subscribed by His Exalted Highness the Nizam for the All-India Queen Victoria Memorial, Calcutta. In 1906, Hyderabad was honoured with a visit by Their Majesties King George V and Queen Mary, then Prince and Princess of Wales, and in 1922 with a visit by their eldest son, His Royal Highness Prince Edward of Wales. The following honours and distinctions have been conferred by the British Government on His Exalted Highness the Nizam :-G. C. S. I., 12th December, 1911 Honorary Colonel, 6th December, 1912; Honorary Colonel, 20th Deccan Horse (now 9th Royal Deccan Horse), 6th December, 1912; G.B.E., 4th December, 1917 Honorary Lieutenant-General, 1st January, 1918; title of His Exalted Highness as an hereditary distinction, 1st January, 1918; title of Faithful Ally of the British Government by an autograph letter from the King, dated 24th January, 1918.

1,Baroda,"THE STATE OF BARODA, in the Gujarat States Agency, is 8,164 square miles in area, has a population of 2,442,007 souls and an average annual revenue of Rs. 2,60,09,000. The Gaekwar family came into prominence about 1720-1721 when Damaji Rao Gaekwar, in appreciation of his superb military services for the Maratha Empire, was appointed by Raja Shahu of Satara to the exalted rank of Second-in-Command with the title of Shamsher Bahadur, which distinction to this day remains a proud title of the Head of the Gaekwar House. Some twenty years later, together with the Peshwa's forces, he laid siege to Ahmedabad and captured it. That was the end of the Moghul powers in Gujarat and that area was apportioned between the Peshwa and the Gaekwar. Damaji Rao greatly distinguished himself in the battle of Panipat. Later on he not only prevented the Moghuls from gaining any advantage in Gujarat from the battle of Panipat but extended his territory by conquering the area which now forms the Mehsana Division of the State. The present Ruler, His Highness Maharaja Sir Sayaji Rao Gaekwar, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., was born in 1863, succeeded to the gaddi in 1875 and was invested with full ruling powers in 1881. His Highness is renowned as one of the most progressive and enlightened of rulers and his State is in every respect a model State. From the memorable day in May, 1875, when His Highness ascended the throne till now, the record of Baroda State has been one of rapid and consistent progress along all lines so that the State stands now in the forefront of Indian India, and has become well known throughout the world as an example of what an enlightened, public- spirited and statesmanlike Ruler can do to ameliorate the lot of his people and promote the moral and material welfare of his subjects. The past half-century has witnessed an advance in the spheres of social reform and education, industry and agriculture, art and culture, which is well-nigh without parallel elsewhere. During the Great War assistance in the shape of men; money and materials was readily forthcoming from Baroda and the strength of the State's loyalty to the Crown, as in the dark days of the Sepoy Mutiny, was amply demonstrated. The number of the subjects of the State who joined the British Indian Army up to November, 1918, as combatants, non-combatants, skilled and unskilled labourers, was 1,417. From the State Regular Forces His Highness Maharaja Sir Sayaji Rao Gaekwar, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., Baroda State. 157 men were allowed to join the British Army.

Lastly, for hospital the Baroda State needed articles as horses, large amount of railway rolling stock and surveying instruments. The Royal Silver Jubilee in May, 1935, was celebrated in the State with befitting eclat. The death of King-Emperor George V in January, 1936, was deeply mourned in the State.  ",SALUTE

It is both an industrial and agricultural State with a population of nearly a million and a half. Hindus forming the bulk of the community. The area of the State is 9,902 square miles with a population of 13,25,089. The normal revenue of the State is nearly Rs. 1,35,99,000. From the point of view of revenue the State stands seventh in the whole of India and first in Central India. a Khanda (broad-sword) and lance, slatire-wise over a field of poppy and a The State was founded by Malhar Rao Holkar. The arms used by wheat the State in consist which of sacred bull (Nandi) couchant and a horse rearing are depicted. A sun in splendour under a chhatri or royal umbrella forms the crest. In 1818 the State entered into a treaty with the British Government and that treaty determines to this day the relationship of the State with them. The State has since then always shown unflinching loyalty to the British Crown. The State has always rendered valuable military and other assistance on occasions of Imperial necessity. Though the wave of disaffection that spread over the country in the Mutiny of 1857 did not leave some of the State troops untouched, the Maharaja with his adherents and remaining troops stood firmly by the British and gave every possible assistance to the British authorities at Indore, Mhow and other places. The help rendered was duly recognised by the British Government. During the Great War of 1914 the State placed all its resources at the disposal of the British Government. Its troops took part in the various theatres of War and the contribution of the State towards the War and relief funds in money was Rs. 41 lakhs and its subscriptions to the War Loans amounted to Rs. 82 lakhs, while the contribution from the Indore people amounted to over 1 crore of rupees. This assistance was acknowledged by His Excellency the Viceroy on behalf of His Majesty the King-Emperor. The Rulers enjoy the hereditary title of 'Maharajadhiraj Raj Rajeshwar Sawai Shree"" and a salute of 21 guns within their own territories and 19 outside them. The present Ruler, His Highness Maharajadhiraj Raj Rajeshwar Sawai Shree Yeshwant Rao Holkar Bahadur, G.C.I.E., was born on the 6th September, 1908. Having received his early education in Indore, he went to England for his Preparatory and Public School education. He remained there from 1920 to 1923. In February 1924 His Highness married a daughter of the Junior Chief of Kagal (Kolhapur), and has one daughter who was born on 20th of October, 1933. After accession to the Throne, His Highness again went to Europe for his higher education in 1926. This time he found a place at the Christ Church College, Oxford. The whole aim of his education was to inculcate in him the power of observation, the capacity to judge men and things, and the habit of looking at questions from a comprehensive point of view. This formation of character and the acquiring of self-discipline was to proceed side by side with the development on the cultural and social side. Oxford furnished the best atmosphere and material for that, and His Highness made the utmost of the opportunities at his disposal. He added to what he acquired at Oxford itself by touring, during vacations, in England, France, Spain, Norway, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Italy and Switzerland, studying the geographical, economic and social, as well as the political and constitutional conditions of each country. When he left Oxford, therefore, in November 1929 to return to Indore, he was fully equipped, both by natural gifts as well as by training, for taking upon himself the responsibilities of the exalted position which has been his lot by birth. His Highness received his administrative training under the direction of Mr. C. U. Wills, C.I.E., a retired Civilian of the Central Provinces Government. He toured through all the and showed districts of the State in order to obtain an intimate knowledge of the condition of his people, him in considerable interest in rural matters. These tours have been useful in bringing welfare of close touch with the agricultural classes who form the backbone very of the State, for the the technicalities whom he of has ever since laboured unceasingly. At headquarters His Highness studied working various departments. of the the complicated machinery of Administration by acquainting himself with the 10 Having been thus fully equipped, His Highness assumed full ruling powers on the 9th May, 1930. On that auspicious day he announced inter alia liberal remissions of all arrears of revenue and Tanka to cultivators and Istamurardars. His Highness also announced that he would limit his Civil List to 11 percent of the income of the State and referred to the possibility of further reducing this percentage if circumstances required it. Ever since the assumption of the reins of administration it has been the constant endeavour of His Highness to study the welfare of all classes of his subjects and to make their interests the first object of his care. When His Highness assumed ruling powers, the present unparalleled economic crisis was beginning to make its mark. His Highness, therefore, started his rule under a serious disadvantage, but it is this disadvantage which has brought out the best in him. In order to cope with the emergency he pursued a policy of vigorous retrenchment consistent with economy. His Highness lost no time in taking such measures as were necessary to meet the financial stringency caused by the world-wide economic depression, and set a noble example by subjecting his Civil List to an emergency cut and reducing his own personal expenditure. Not self but service has been the principle of his life. This financial stringency has not deterred His Highness from adopting measures He for the promotion of the moral and material well-being of his subjects at considerable expense. a very creditable record and have justified the hope that his rule will more than fulfil that has also been reforming the administration, and the results within such a short time constitute the expectations of his people.

On his death in 1911 he was succeeded by his eldest son, Maharaja Sir Sumer Singh, K.B.E., then a boy of thirteen. He served in France with his Imperial Service Cavalry during the Great War. The traditional bravery of the Rathors was strikingly illustrated in the military achievements of the Jodhpur Cavalry, both in France and Palestine. The Sardar Rissala was the recipient of no fewer than 88 awards from the Government of India to its officers and other ranks for distinguished services in the field. For his War services Maharaja Sumer Singh was made Honorary Lieutenant in the British Army and promoted to the brother, the present Ruler. honorary rank of Major.

For improving water supply in villages liberal grants are made by Government every year as also loans to cultivators for sinking irrigation wells. Much has been done to improve the Excise Department, the Excise laws and rules having been thoroughly revised. The State has considerable mineral resources like salt, gypsum, Fuller's earth, wolfram, building stone of various colours, and marble from the famous Makrana quarries. The Mines and Industries Department, which is being rapidly modernised, is also encouraging various local industries. There are steadily increasing grants for the development of schemes of social service consistently with the improved standards of present-day living. The Medical Department is growing rapidly. The Windham Hospital, costing about Rs. 17 lakhs, is a model in its line. Zenana Hospital arrangements are equally progressive. The construction of a new Women's Hospital at a cost of about Rs. 12 lakhs is in progress. There are now 28 well-equipped Dispensaries in the Districts and the Government is committed to a policy of building one new dispensary each year. The progress of education is remarkable. The number of educational institutions has increased from 54 to 161 including a notable rise in the number of girls' schools. The annual budget allotment for education has risen from Rs. 75,000 to Rs. 7 lakhs. The Boy Scouts and Girl Guides Movements have also received considerable impetus. The growth of civic sense is being inculcated by an increasing number of Municipalities. The Dharampura Department, dealing with State charities, maintains an Ashram for children and the destitute. The Archological Department, with a Museum and an excellent Library for the public, is actively engaged in the preservation of ancient monuments. The first Railway line in the Jodhpur State was constructed in 1882, and the total mileage at present is about 800 miles, which has cost the State a little over 412 crores of rupees. The Jodhpur Railway Administration also works the Hyderabad Section of 288 miles belonging to the British Government. The Railway brings in a net profit of about Rs. 37 lakhs a year, which amounts to nearly 9% on capital outlay. The Public Works Department is markedly active. The expenditure during 1935 amounted to 31 lakhs of rupees against 6 lakhs 25 years ago. In addition to stately buildings of public utility like the Windham Hospital, Darbar High School, Jaswant College, Rajput Schools, Sardar Market, Clock Tower, State Hotel and the Marble Cenotaph, it has constructed 276 miles of metalled roads and 837 miles of dressed up motorable tracks; also 18 irrigation tanks irrigating 60,000 bighas of land. To meet the increasing needs of the City a new reservoir, Umedsagar, was recently constructed. His Highness personally contributed Rs. 2 lakhs towards its cost. The famous Jodhpur Aerodrome is supplemented by 17 other aeroplane landing grounds in the State. The newly formed Development Department has been showing much progress in town-planning and improvements. The Electrical Department also has developed correspondingly with the general progress of the State, The Army too has been reorganised in thorough conformity with the new order of things. In short, under its present Ruler, Jodhpur can well claim the distinction of being one of the happiest States in India in regard to all-round progress and prosperity. The Royal Silver Jubilee in May, 1935, was befittingly celebrated in the State under the personal guidance of His Highness and the State officials. The total amount collected in the State towards the Silver Jubilee Fund was about Rs. 21 lakhs, which was the highest figure in Rajputana. The death of His Imperial Majesty the King-Emperor George V in January, 1936, was deeply mourned all over the State. 25",SALUTE

Years of hard and patient study preceded a course of practical administra- tive training at the important seats of Government in India. During this period His Highness equipped himself for the onerous responsibilities of administration which lay ahead of him by learning the intricacies of modern administration not only in such capital cities as Mysore and Madras but in the remoter headquarters of the District officials. A comparative study of administrations, informative discussions with his own departmental heads combined with extensive travels and inspiring friend- ships amply fitted His Highness to take over the reins of administration at an early age. The Investiture was marked by universal enthusiasm and joy throughout the State and the Capital city put on an appearance befitting the occasion. His Highness's address at the Durbar set out patriotic ideals and envisaged practical and important measures of relief to his subjects. The Land Mortgage Bank, then set up, gives succour to the agriculturists in these times of distress and the 'Home for the Destitute and the Infirm' opened by Her Highness provides shelter to many in need.

The nation-building activities of Government have received a fresh impetus during the short period of His Highness's rule. Recognising the fact that the modern day administration in its various branches tends to become a specialised art, committees were constituted to tender expert advice to His Highness's Government in the fields of education, co-operation and economic development. Most of the recommend- ations of these committees have been accepted by Government and are being implemented. The most remarkable feature of the nation-building activities of the Government has been the distinct industrial bias' which the Government have received as a result of His Highness's tour in the industrialised West in the year 1933, at a very impressionable age.

These combined with the efforts at making the High Ranges-hitherto an inaccessible part of the territory-available for occupation and cultivation by the construction of a big bridge across the Periyar, opened by His Highness in 1935, bid fair to relieve the present economic distress of the people and to point the way towards the economic prosperity of the State.

In an educationally advanced country like Travancore, leadership of the Sovereign has its own undisputed advantages. Workers in the social field have received great encouragement by His Highness's deep solicitude for the welfare and moral elevation of the depressed classes. And by his recent Proclamation that ""there should henceforth be no restriction placed on any Hindu by birth or religion on entering or worshipping at temples controlled by Us and Our Government,"" His Highness has translated into courageous action that deep solicitude. By this act His Highness has practically eradicated untouchability in the State and the step has been acclaimed as an epoch-making reform unparalleled in the history of India for its comprehensiveness and scope. To guide the artistic tastes of the people of Travancore, a State Art Gallery has been established at the Capital. These endeavours of His Highness to live and rule for the benefit of all sections and creeds of His Highness's subjects have assured him unique popularity amongst his people. His popularity and his subjects' affection for him found vent in the universal rejoicings which marked the conferment by His Imperial Majesty of the high distinction of G.C.I.E. on His Highness in June, 1935. Amidst the heavy responsibilities of the Ruler of a modern State, His Highness does not neglect the practice and encouragement of games and sport. A keen all-round sportsman, His Highness is parti- cularly proficient in riding, motoring and lawn tennis. The Boy Scout Movement thrives in the State under His Highness's patronage.

23,Orchha,"ORCHHA is the premier treaty State in the Bundelkhand Agency and the fourth in the whole of Central India the first three being Indore, Bhopal and Rewa. It is bounded on the north and west by the Jhansi District, on the south by the Saugor District (Central Provinces) and the States of Bijawar and Panna and on the east by the States of Charkhari, Bijawar and Garrauli. The State is a treaty State with full sovereign rights. and pays 110 tribute to the British Government or to any other State. It is the only State in Bundelkhand which was not held under subjection by any power, not even by the Moghuls or the Peshwas. Tikamgarh is the present Capital. Orchha, the old Capital, is now the headquarters of a Sub- division. The Jhansi-Bhopal and Jhansi-Manikpur sections of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway pass through the State, touching Orchha and some other towns. The total area of the State is 2,080 square miles. The country is generally flat and in parts typical of an alluvial spread. It possesses a climate more subject to extremes of heat and cold than that of the Malwa Plateaux. The population, according to the Census of 1931, is 3,14,661. Ninety-five per cent. of the population are Hindus, 3 per cent. Muslims and 2 per cent. Jains. The language is Bundelkhandi, a local form of Hindi. The annual revenue of the State borders on about 15 lakhs. The Ruler is entitled to a hereditary salute of 15 guns and the hereditary titles of Sawai Mahendra Maha- raja and Saramad-i-Rajaha-i-Bundelkhand, the latter having been granted by the British Government in 1882. The Ruling family are Bundela (Vindhyala) Kshatriyas of the Solar line. The Ruler of the State is also the recognised Head of the Bundela clan, all the other Bundela families being the offshoots of the Orchha House. The Bundelas are descended from the Gahirwal Rajputs, who were formerly the Rulers of Benares. The Orchha House traces its origin to Maharaja Hemkaran, better known as Pancham Bundela, who was a son of Raja Karan Pal, it Gahirwal Chief, whose descent has been traced to Lava, the eldest son of the epic hero Rama. Hemkaran was expelled from Benares by his brothers, who were jealous of his outstanding abilities. He emigrated to the Vindhya mountains and founded there a new kingdom in the middle of the 11th century. Bir Bhadra, the eldest son and successor of Hemkaran, greatly extended the boundaries of the State. In the year 1531, Ru Ira Pratap, charmed by the beautiful site on which Orchha now stands, began to build a palace there with the intention of making it his Capital. It was during the reign of his successor, Maharaja Bharti Chan.l, that most of the palaces were completed and the Bundela Capital was finally removed to this place in 1539. The State possessions at this time extended from the Sindh River to the Tons and from the Jamuna to the Narbada. A period of misfortune thereafter followed. In 1577, and again in 1598, the Moghuls overran the State and annexed all the districts between Gwalior, Sironj and the Capital. The already shrunken State was soon parcelled out amongst the eight sons of one of the Chiefs. The fortunes of the State were subse- quently restored by Maharaja Vir Singh Dev I, as he had won the favour of Emperor Jehangir before he came to the throne. He extended his authority over the whole of the Western Bundelkhand and also part of Baghelkhand. He was a great builder and has left many monuments. The principal events of historical interest during the next hundred years in the history of Orchha the branching off of the Houses of Datia and Panna the invasion of the Emperor Shah Jehan and the are incursions of the Mahrattas. These had materially reduced the area of the State when Maharaja Vikramajit, a powerful Ruler, succeeded to the gaddi. He partially rehabilitated the decaying glory of the his State and entered into a treaty with the British Government in 1812. He also changed the seat of capital from Orchha to Tikamgarh.

There is a network of Railways extending over nearly 200 miles, while a further branch of nearly 30 miles, known as Talala-Visavadar line, is under construction. The State also owns a six-anna share in the Jetalsar-Rajkot Railway line extending over a distance of 461 miles. The State has invested a sum of Rs. 156 lakhs in its railways. Junagadh is well equipped in respect of good roads. There are 212 miles of tarred roads, 2741 miles of water-bound macadamised roads and 143 miles of fair-weather roads. It is possible to go to any part of the State by car. There is adequate provision of communicat- ions on which the development both of agriculture and industry largely depends. The State maintains its own Darbar Postal Service which is supple- mentary to the Indian Postal Service. This local service dates back to 1864 and is of much use in serving the smaller towns and villages. The Head Office is located in Junagadh and there are 25 sub-offices at convenient centres. Junagadh abounds in several ancient and noteworthy monuments like the Edicts of Asoka, Somnath Temple at Prabhas Patan and the Uparkot Citadel and Mount Girnar with its Jain and Hindu temples. Besides these, the other notable monuments are the Khapra Kodia Caves, Mai Gadhechi's Cave, Pancheshwar, the Khengar Vav or well, all of which are situated in or near Junagadh Shahzada Mohamad Dilawarkhanji, Heir-Apparent, Junagadh State.

The history of the origin of the ancient fort of Uparkot is very conflicting. According to the Tarikh-e-Sorath, it was built in the reign of Raja Ugrasena, King of Mathura, in pre-historic times. It undoubtedly existed in the reign of Chandra Gupta Maurya, grand-father of Asoka, who built the Sudarshana Lake in 300 B.C. and died in 297 B.C. This lake was situated between the Fort and the foot of the Girnar Hill. The remains of the dam of this famous lake still exist by the side of the road leading to the Girnar Hills, Again in A.D. 950 approximately, it was built, as it now stands, by Raj Grahripu of Wamansthali (Vanthali of today). It was captured by Mahmed Begda in 1470 A.D. after a two years' siege when Ra Mandlik, the last of the Chudasamas, surrendered. It was finally restored by him in 1473 A.D. Inside the Uparkot Citadel is the Lilam Top, a gun 17 feet long, 6 feet and 51/2016 inches in circumference at the thickest part of the barrel and 4 feet and 52 inches at the thinnest, its bore at the muzzle being 912 inches.

As an indication of its authority, no fewer than one hundred and thirty-four States and Talukas still pay Zortalbi, literally forcible levy, to Junagadh amounting to Rs. 92,421-8-0. MODERN HISTORY. When the British first entered Kathiawar to check the terrible disorder and bloodshed that prevailed, they came as the nominal allies of the Gaekwar and the Junagadh Ruler, who soon understood the benevolent intentions of the British Government, entered into friendly relations which have continued unbroken to the present day. The State pays a tribute of Rs. 28,394 annually to the Paramount Power and a Peshkashi of Rs. 37,210 to His Highness the Gaekwar of Baroda. The Ruler bears the title of Nawab. The present Ruler, His Highness Sir Mahabat Khanji III, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., is ninth in succession and seventh in descent from His Highness Bahadur Khanji I, the founder of the Babi family of Junagadh in 1735 A.D. His Highness the Nawab Sahib was born on the 2nd August, 1900, and succeeded to the gaddi on the 22nd January, 1911. He visited England in 1913-14, received his education at the Mayo College, Ajmer, and was invested with full powers on the 31st March, 1920. His Highness was awarded the insignia of K.C.S.I. on the 1st January, 1926, and was created G.C.I.E. on the 1st January, 1931. His Highness the Nawab Sahib, as Ruler of the premier State in Kathiawar, ranks first among Princes and Chiefs of Kathiawar, enjoying plenary powers and enjoys a personal salute of 15 guns, the permanent salute being 15 guns within and 13 guns outside Junagadh territory. His Highness the Nawab Sahib is the supreme and final authority in the State and the general administration is conducted under his direction, though a large measure of authority has been entrusted to his Diwan and other officers. Their Excellencies Lord Reading, Lord Irwin and Lord Willingdon visited the State during the reign of the present Ruler. The Heir-Apparent, Shahzada Mohammad Dilawar Khanji, was born on the 23rd June, 1922, and is at present being educated in England along with his brother, Nawabzada Mohammad Himatkhanji. Mangrol is included in and forms an integral portion of the Junagadh State. The Shaikh Sahib is a vassal of Junagadh and has been granted by His Highness the Nawab Sahib administrative powers commensu- rate with those of a second class State under the Agency to be exercised in his Swang estate in subordination to Junagadh. The Executive Council of the State consists of the Diwan and President, Second Member, Law Member, Revenue Member and an Additional Member. The Military forces maintained by the State are the Junagadh State Lancers and the Mahabat Khanji Infantry, the sanctioned strength of which is 173 and 219 respectively. The strength of the Police is 1 to 570 of the population and, inclusive of the village police, it is 1 to 179 souls. Civil and Criminal justice is administered under exis- ting codes.

33,Kapurthala,"THE STATE OF KAPURTHALA, comprising an area of 652 square miles, lies between the rivers Sutlej and Beas in the Punjab. The Maharaja also owns a large number of villages in the Amritsar and Lahore districts as well as estates in the province of Oudh larger in area than the Kapurthala State proper, embracing as they do 461,032 acres or 700 square miles. The major portion of these estates was granted by the British Government to the present Maharaja's grandfather, His Highness Raja-i-Rajgan Raja Randhir Singh of illustrious memory, for conspicuous services during the Mutiny. The Maharaja of Kapurthala thus enjoys among the Ruling Princes in India the peculiar distinction of being both the head of an important State and the premier Taluqdar of Oudh. The gross income of the State is about forty lakhs. The inhabitants of the State number about 316,000, of whom 56 per cent. are Mohammadans, 22 per cent. Sikhs and 22 per cent. Hindus. The Royal House of Kapurthala is descended from the Rajput Ruling Dynasty of Jaisalmer. The foundation of the State was laid by Rana Kapur of Jaisalmer about nine hundred years ago. Of the ancestors of the present Maharaja the most outstanding figure in history was Raja Jassa Singh who was known for his matchless prowess and military genius. As a warrior Raja Jassa Singh had no equal in his time. He was a terror to the enemy of the Khalsa. The massive sword with which he had achieved many historic conquests in personal combats is preserved as a precious heirloom in the State Treasury at Kapurthala. On the extension of British rule to the Jullundur Doab in 1846 the independence of the State proper, north of the Sutlej, was maintained, conditional on the State paying to the British Government the commutation in cash amounting to Rs. 1,31,000 for the service engagements by which it had been bound to the Sikh Confederacy. The Bari Doab estate was also leased to the head of the House in perpetuity. In 1924 this annual tribute was remitted in perpetuity by the British Government in appreciation of the magnificent war record and exceptionally efficient administration of the State. This paved the way for a lasting friendship between the Kapurthala State and the British Raj. From that day the State has never missed a single opportunity of demonstrating its fidelity to the Paramount Power and has on every necessary occasion readily placed its resources at the disposal of the British Sovereigns. During the Mutiny Raja Randhir Singh directed all his available forces, under his personal command, towards the maintenance and consolidation of the British hold upon the Jullundur Doab, and, at a most critical moment in Oudh in those dark days, personally led a contingent of two thousand men to those regions, and, by his characteristic pluck and prowess, helped immensely in saving the situation. His rewards for these invaluable services included the grant in perpetuity of the extensive estates in the Bahraich and Bara Banki districts already referred to. Rajah Randhir Singh was a ruler of exceptional abilities and was immensely popular with his subjects, irrespective of race and creed, for his wise, progressive and impartial administra- tion. On his way to England in 1870 he was taken ill at Aden and expired in mid-ocean during his journey back to India. His sudden passing away in the prime of life, and right in the midst of an unending succession of beneficent activities, was deeply mourned, not only by his loving subjects, but far beyond the confines of his State. The Viceroy paid a tribute to his memory in the most feeling terms and referred to his death as the loss to the British Government of an attached and valued friend and a Chief who by a vigorous and progressive administration had set an example to other Rulers."" He was succeeded by his son, Raja Kharak Singh, who possessed a vigorous mind in a frail body and died quite young in the seventh year of his rule, namely, in September, 1877. The present benign and englightened Ruler of Kapurthala, Colonel His Highness Farzand-i-Dilband Rashikul-Itigad Daulat-i-Inglishia Raja-i-Rajgan Maharaja Sir Jagatjit Singh Bahadur, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., G.B.E., was born on the 24th November, 1872, and was barely five years old when he was installed on the gaddi on the 16th October, 1877, by Sir Robert Egerton, the 52 then Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab. During his minority the State was fortunate in having its management entrusted to a succession of British Superintendents of such high calibre as Sir Lepel Griffin, K.C.S.I., Sir Macworth Young, K.C.S.I., Sir Charles Rivaz, K.C.S.I., and Colonel C. F. Massey-to mention only the most prominent of them. Almost all of them afterwards made a mark as heads of Provincial Administrations in India. Under the guidance and management of such able and brilliant Superintendents the State made rapid strides in regard to all the requirements of the modern age, and the young Maharaja, besides receiving an exceptionally liberal education, was brought up in every way with strict regard to his exalted heritage. At a very early age the Maharaja showed a remarkable linguistic aptitude and by the time he attained his majority he had become a thorough master of English and French as well as of Sanskrit, Persian and Urdu. His Highness assumed the government of His State on the 24th November, 1890. In performing the formal ceremony Sir James Lyall, the then Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, spoke highly of the Prince and of his illustrious family and expressed every confidence as to the future progress and welfare of the State under His Highness' able and enlightened rule. Those who know Kapurthala of to-day will readily admit that his confidence has been realised to the letter. With a view to broadening his own mental outlook as well as to learn things that might be of practical value to his State, His Highness has made extensive tours the wide world over. There is, indeed, no Indian or foreign Prince more widely travelled than His Highness. The first of the foreign visits was made three years after the assumption of the government of his State, in the course of which he attended the marriage of His Imperial Majesty King George V, then Duke of York. His Highness has since travelled all over India, Europe, of Jagatjit Palace, Kapurthala. America, Tunis, Morocco, these Abyssinia, tours the Japan, reputation China, of Indo-China, His Highness Java, as a that singularly in His fact, Highness all cultured over and has the progressive ruler has always with the warmest cordiality and the greatest respect honours associated with habitable globe. During travelled before him, with the result by the Sovereigns invariably of the States been he has received visited and also has been invested with the highest 53 these States. In addition to the most exalted British decorations His Highness is the possessor of the highest foreign decorations like the Grand Cross of the Legion d'Honneur of France, the Grand Cross of the Order of Carlos III of Spain, the Grand Cross of the Order of Star of Roumania, the Grand Cross of the Order of Menelik of Abyssinia, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Nile of Egypt, the Grand Cordon of the Order of Morocco, the Grand Cordon of the Order of Tunis, the Grand Cross of the Order of Chili, the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun of Peru, and the Grand Cross of the Order of Cuba. His Highness' well-known publication embodying his experiences of foreign travel has been read, as was to be expected, with the greatest interest all over the civilized world. His Highness' remarkable power of observation, deep insight into things, profound scholarship and high literary ability will be found amply demonstrated in this monumental work. Much of the progressive spirit which His Highness has infused into his administration is due as much to his strong personality as to the effect of his foreign tours on his remarkably receptive mind. His Highness' highly cultivated taste will be found embodied in not a few handsome palaces and buildings which adorn Kapurthala of to-day. The great Jagatjit Palace, designed by an eminent French architect in the Renaissance style and built at a cost of about five million rupees, is a sight for the gods, and the magnificent park attached to it, laid out somewhat on the lines of the Park of Versailles, has no equal in Asia. The interior decoration of the Palace represents the best specimens of European and Indian art and is unique of its kind in India. The great Durbar Hall, conceived and built exclusively in the Indian style, is one of the finest in India. Among other buildings of note the most remarkable are the Villa Buona Vista, the residence of the Heir-Apparent, the Sikh Temple, the Jubilee Hall and the Chateau at Mussourie. British The models of Jagatjit Palace and the Sikh Temple attracted considerable notice at the Wembley Empire Exhibition. Another architectural triumph associated with Kapurthala is which majestic His mosque, designed and executed in pure Moorish style by a renowned French architect, a Highness has had built for the benefit of his Mohammadan subjects. administration His Highness and the moral the and Maharaja material spares neither pains nor money for the efficiency of directing share in the work of administration uplift of in his which people. he His is Highness takes a very large With apparent the and intelligent his Chief Minister, Col.

To ensure the financial independence of the agriculturists Co- operative Credit Banks have been started all over the State. The movement has made a remarkable ad- vance in the State. There are already in the State as many as some three hundred banks, with more in prospect considering the present progress of The Mosque, Kapurthala. things in this direction. We doubt if any district in the Punjab can show better results in this respect. The medical and sanitary department of the State is on a par with the general efficiency of administration. There is in the Capital a thoroughly well-equipped hospital for males and another for females and the headquarters of each tehsil is provided with a State dispensary where free medical relief is afforded to sufferers. Not the least notable of the many amenities enjoyed by the Capital is a perfectly scientific works water and drainage system. The progress of the State is equally noteworthy in regard to means of communication both for the facility of human traffic and commercial advance. Besides the addition of many miles of metalled road, a new metalled road has been constructed between Kapurthala and Kala, the latter being an important cotton-growing centre. The Jullundur Doab Railway also passes through twenty-five miles of State territory including the Capital and Sultanpur. The provision made in the State for internal security leaves nothing to be desired. An armed police force has also been raised for this purpose the efficient working of which has been highly spoken of by the British authorities. The loyalty and attachment of Kapurthala to the British Empire, as we have already has been demonstrated beyond question on every occasion ever since the Jullundur Doab been seen, under British rule in 1846. The high traditions of his House in this respect have fully came and faithfully maintained by the present Ruler.

All this represents only a part to the Empire in titanic struggle. The immense popularity which His Highness the Maharaja enjoys, not only all over India, but all over the civilised world, had a striking demonstration at the Golden Jubilee of His Highness' accession to the gaddi of his ancestors celebrated in November, 1927, with a splendour unparalleled except in the courts of Eastern monarchs of the Middle Age. H. E. the Viceroy, H. E. the Commander-in-Chief, H. E. the Governor of the Punjab, all the leading Princes of India and hundreds of Indian and European guests from different parts of the country visited Kapurthala and participated in the function with an enthusiasm which testified with unmistakable emphasis to the affection and esteem in which His Highness is universally held. His Highness also received innumerable telegraphic messages of cordial congratulations from distinguished monarchs and statesmen of Europe and also from those of his brother Princes in India who were unavoidably prevented from attending the celebrations. Countless presents also poured in on that happy and memorable occasion from His Highness' friends in Europe, America and India as well as from his officers and subjects both in Kapurthala and Oudh. The carrying to a successful termination of SO imposing a programme of festivities as had been arranged for that historic occasion was due as much to the organising powers and forceful personality of the Maharaja himself as to the energy and ability of Captain Maharaj Kumar Amarjit Singh, M. A., President of the Special Committee appointed for the purpose. The importance of that great function lay, as every intelligent observer might have seen and realised, less in its magnificence than in the impressive illustration it furnished of the closer ties of relationship and mutual understanding between the British Government and the State of a solidarity of interests between the Ruling Chiefs themselves and of the good-will and affection existing between the Ruler and his subjects in Kapurthala. With regard to the last-mentioned fact the following happy and graceful message of His Highness on that auspicious occasion is worthy blessed of record:-"") rejoice to feel that by the grace of Providence this long period has been and that with peace, inter-communal amity and general advancement among beloved people Rest assured the happiest that in relations the have perpetually existed between them and myself my and my House. of my life and the key-note future, of as in the past, your welfare shall always be the primary object nounced a of my policy."" To commemorate the occasion His Highness an- Irwin Jubilee grant two lakhs of rupees for the construction of an up-to-date called by the association Memorial of Hospital. His Excellency the Viceroy expressed himself hospital honoured a brief but Banquet, which presented a scene of unrivalled happy occasion. At the State his name with that institution SO eminently worthy of that as with gave special reference remarkably lucid and impressive account of half splendour, His Highness to certain sound principles which, as a Ruler, a century had guided of his and life inspired and reign, him 56 in his long and fruitful career, not the least outstanding of which was absolute impartiality and even balance between different sects and religions. In that admirable speech of his His Highness made a masterful survey of the position of the States and of the way it was to be adjusted in relation to the Government of India after the constitutional Reforms in the making had reached a workable phase. His Highness' statesmanlike utterances on that great occasion made, it is needless to add, a profound impression on that great assemblage. With regard to the remarkably friendly relations existing between the Hindus and the Muslims in his State, His Highness, referring to the sorry state of things in that respect in other parts of India, made the following notable statement : ""I am happy to say that such communal feelings have never existed in my State, and I pray God they never will. Perhaps it will interest you all to learn that for the benefit of my Mohammadan subjects I am building a mosque which will, when it is completed, be one of the finest in India and which has been designed by an eminent French architect in Moorish style after the famous Kutubia Mosque of Marakesh."" Speaking of the administration of his State, His Highness referred in highly appreciative terms to the invaluable assistance he had received towards the unique success thereof from his talented Chief Minister, Khan Bahadur Diwan Abdul Hamid. His Excellency the Viceroy paid an eloquent tribute to His Highness' qualities as a Ruler and Statesman and spoke in the following felicitous terms of His Highness' beneficent work for the welfare and prosperity of his subjects :- ""The brief sketch you gave us to-night, Your Highness, of the progress in internal administration during the last fifty years was enough to indicate the vast improvement which your rule has brought to the State. It is not for me to follow you in detail through them, but I know both from my own personal observation and from what I have heard from my advisers that Kapurthala ranks high among the Indian States in the quality of administration. This, I have no doubt, is largely due to the keen interest Your Highness has always taken personally in State affairs and to the attention in detail which you apply in a remarkable degree to all that comes under your observation."" His Excellency also spoke in terms of the highest praise of the Chief Minister. ""Among the most valuable qualities in any Ruler,"" he said, is the faculty to choose wisely those to whom he entrusts responsibility and the capacity to trust those whom he has chosen. I know very well how much, as you have said, Your Highness' State owes to the ability and efficiency of your Chief Minister, Khan Bahadur Diwan Abdul Hamid, who has enjoyed for the Your Highness' confidence and filled this responsible post with success and credit last twelve years."" this high standard in the public service His Excellency rightly attributed sections the peace of contentment To prevailing in the State and the harmony existing among the various and signifi- and subjects.

The subjects of His Highness presented an address paying a glowing and grateful tribute to His Highness' progressive and beneficent rule and warmly acknowledging the untold blessings of that rule as evidenced in the growing moral and material prosperity of the people in the trail of important educational, agricultural and administrative reforms and the flourishing condition of trade and commerce generally in consequence thereof. Equally eloquent and appreciative was the address presented by the tenants of Oudh. It summed up the various happy and progressive features of His Highness' long and enlightened rule in terms which, with all their blazing eloquence born of the fulness of heart, represented only the barest truth. ""In fact,"" it concluded, ""it would be no exaggeration to say that the benefits and favours which Your Highness has heaped upon your devoted subjects are unexampled in history."" At the State Banquet the toast of His Highness was proposed by His Highness the Maharaja of Kashmir in befitting terms. He referred to the great respect in which His Highness the Maharaja of Kapurthala, on account of his many eminent qualities of head and heart as well as for his many golden deeds towards the welfare of mankind in and outside his State, was held both by his brother Princes and representatives of the British Government. He specially commended His Highness' work on the Chamber of Princes and also in connection with the League of Nations which, he rightly said, "" reflected credit not only on the whole country but also on the whole of our Order."" His Highness' health was drunk with immense enthusiasm. In a brilliant speech the Maharaja of Alwar dwelt, with his characteristic eloquence and amidst repeated applause, on His Highness' numerous high qualities which had endeared him not only to his friends and guests but, most important of all, to his subjects. In October, 1928, at the invitation of His Majesty the King, His Highness, accompanied by the Tikka Raja (heir-apparent) and his staff, paid a State visit to the Court of Spain and was accorded a right royal reception both by the Royal House and the public. In September, 1930, His Highness went to Geneva for the third time to represent India and the Ruling Princes of India at the 10th Assembly of the League of Nations, a distinction not enjoyed by any other Ruling Prince in India so far. His Highness, it is needless to add, gave on this occasion as eminently impressive an account of himself as on the two former occasions. In 1931, with the consent of His Highness the Maharaja, the then Chief Minister, Khan Bahadur Diwan Abdul Hamid, was selected by His Excellency the Viceroy and the Right Hon'ble the Secretary of State as one of the principal delegates to the 12th Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva, in particular as a representative of the Indian States. A gracious reference of apprecia- tion of his work at the League Assembly was made by His Excellency the Viceroy in his opening speech at the inauguration of the Session of the Chamber of Princes in March, 1932. A resolution of thanks and appreciation was unanimously passed by Their Highnesses the Ruling Princes in the course of the Session of the Chamber of Princes. His Highness is blessed with five sons and one daughter. The young Princes were brought up and educated under the direct supervision of His Highness the Maharaja. Their education began at home under competent English and French governesses and was finished in English and French Colleges and Universities. The eldest son, Sri Tikka Raja Paramjit Singh, was born on the 19th of May, 1892, and the happy event was befittingly celebrated throughout the State. He has a worthy consort in Princess Brinda Mati, a daughter of Kanwar Gambhir Chand of Jubbal. She was brought up and educated in France and is a perfect model of cultured and accomplished womanhood. The happy marriage was solemnised on the 4th February, 1911, amidst scenes of unsurpassed splendour and rejoicing and was attended by a large number of distinguished guests from various 58 parts of India and Europe. That auspicious occasion was rendered memorable by the announce- ment by His Highness of important concessions to his people. His Highness the Maharaja and the Princes. The second son, Maharaj Kumar Mahajit Singh, was an exceptionally cultured and gifted Prince whose sad and untimely death on the 9th April, 1932, it unfortunately happens to be our painful duty to record here with the sincerest and deepest grief. His marriage in November, 1913, after his return home on finishing his education in Europe, with the accomplished daughter of a high caste Rajput family of Chandpur in the Kangra District, was celebrated amidst scenes of matchless magnificence and was attended by prominent people of the country and by deputations from all Indian States. As Superintendent of the Oudh Estates, the late lamented Prince had endeared himself to the tenants by his energetic and efficient discharge of duties, his keen sense of justice and liberal-mindedness, and as a Minister in the United Provinces Government, as is well known, he had given a singularly creditable account of himself. His premature passing away, in the midst of his multifarious activities for public good, has been deeply mourned all over the country. His Highness' third son, Maharaj Kumar Amarjit Singh, is a highly cultured and accomplished Prince and is just now in charge of the Army and Police Departments of the State. the He is a Master of Arts of Oxford. During the Great War he served with distinction with has Indian Contingent in France.

It his an extended sea-coast of about 100 miles and the harbours of Jodiya, Bedi and Salaya. There are pearl-fisheries on the Nawanagar coast. The Ruling family belongs to the famous Jadeja clan, from which the Rulers of Cutch also trace their descent. The Maharaja is entitled to be received and visited by the Viceroy. The State was founded in 1840 by Jam Rawal, a renowned Rajput warrior from Cutch. From that time till the penetration of the British on the decline of the Moghul Empire the history of Nawanagar may well be said to have been an almost unbroken story of the old Rajput military prowess and enterprise. It was during the reign of Jam Ranmalji, who succeeded to the gaddi in 1820, that the State was completely free from internecine feuds, and that good and able Ruler had thus the time and opportunities to give his people a beneficient government. Jam Ranmalji's masterly handling of the situation during the three great famines of his time is proverbial to this day and is the subject of many a homely song by bards and peasants handed down from generation to generation. To give his people work during the hard times he built the magnificent island forts of Kotha and Lakhota, and to his foresight the people of Jamnagar owe the excellent Talao which to-day stores water for summer for public use. Ranmalji was succeeded by Jam Vibhaji in 1852. Vibhaji's love for his people, his great and constant concern for the rich and poor alike, his charitable- mindedness and his extreme simplicity are a by-word in every Jamnagar home. Realising the strength of the British, he entered into firm alliance with them and was amply rewarded for his faithful allegiance. Jam Vibhaji was succeeded by Jam Jassaji who died heirless in 1907 and was succeeded by Jam Shri His Highness Jam Shri Digvijaysinhji, Nawanagar State. before Jassaji was born.

Better known as 'Ranji"" on the cricket field, some of his record achievements are yet to be broken and many of his stylish and easy strokes are even to-day proclaimed by the best of cricketers as inimitable. With him cricket was not merely a game it was, to use his own words, ""a mode of life."" Jam Shri Ranjitsinhji's record achievements were not merely confined to the field of sports. The Nawanagar gaddi was not exactly a bed of loses when he succeeded in 1907. Beginning with a treasury with little balance, with an old-fashioned and abominably dirty city for his Capital, and an ultra-conservative and is practically illiterate people for his subjects, he before long recreated Nawanagar and made it what it to-day-a model State in the most modern sense of the term. He was his own engineer in planning and rebuilding his city, his own economist in introducing far-reaching fiscal and other reforms, and his own adviser in instituting an efficient and up-to-date administrative machinery. To improve the agriculturists' lot he abolished the out-of-date bagh batai and substituted it by a low cash assessment. He also abolished the system of tenure-at-will, and gave his people in its place, after a thorough survey of all holdings in the State, a 15-year settlement system with right to transfer holdings by sale, inheritance or gift. To make the State famine-proof all the rivers in the State were harnessed, many new irrigation canals constructed, 62 and the 25%, the value multiplied.

At once his thoughts fled to his people and his State; and he determined that his people should have the benefit of a Solarium. It was, unfortunately, not given to him to see it completed ; but there it is to-day-its revolving top rising like a mammoth peroplane-completed by his able and distingnished successor at an enormous cost, a marvel of science and a priceless boon to suffering humanity. It is the only institution of its kind in this part of the world. To-day every corner of the State is served by a qualified doctor with a modern Dispensary.

He belonged to the famous Bareha Syeds, and was a great soldier, a consummate statesman and a born leader of men. In his time his kingdom comprised the whole of Rohilkhand and Kamaun divisions and parts of the adjoining territory as well. The Rampur State, as it is now, is 892 square miles in area with a population of about six lakhs and an annual income of over fifty lakhs of rupees. The Rampur town is picturesque and well populated and is noted for its manufactures of damask pottery, sugar and jewellery. During the Mutiny of 1857 Nawab Syed Yusuf Ali Khan Bahadur effectively helped the British with men and money and in various other ways. For those services he was granted a new territory now known as Ilaqa Jadeed.

Its Rulers, descended from a younger branch of the Jodhpur family, have always maintained their hereditary supremacy over all the Rajput Chiefs in Malwa. The premier position of Ratlam is testified to by such high authorities as Malcolm and Aitchison. General Sir John Malcolm, G.C.B., wrote in his ""Memoirs of Malwa when he was in military and political charge of Central India over a century ago :-"" From being at the head of a large and powerful family the Ruler of Ratlam has great influence and can upon emergency call a numerous band of his kindred and clansmen into the field."" In the same work he has elsewhere observed that the Rajput Chiefs of Malwa have acted no inconsiderable part and many have preserved the independent rule of their own lands."") To quote in this connection from Sir Charles Aitchison's ""Treaties and Engagements,"" first published half a century ago, the Ruler of Ratlam ""is considered the principal Rajput leader in Western Malwa and, in consequence, receives a voluntary allegiance and assistance, if called for, from the neighbouring Rajput Chiefs."" The present Ruler, Major-General His Highness Maharaja Sir Sajjan Singhji Bahadur, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., A.D.C. to His Majesty the King-Emperor, succeeded to the gaddi in 1893. As a member of the Imperial Cadet Corps from 1901 to 1903 he gave a brilliant account of himself. His Highness also made his mark as a polo star even while he was in his teens. His first tournament was played at Mhow when he was only 17 years of age. In 1911 His Highness won the Coronation Polo Tournament Gold Cup in Calcutta and had the honour 67 of receiving it from the hands of his Sovereign King George V, Emperor of India. Ten years later, in November, 1921, in Bombay, His Highness won the Prince of Wales Commemo- ration Polo Tournament Cup and had the pri- vilege of receiving it from the hands of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales who, later in the same month, honoured Ratlam with a brief visit, dining with His Highness at Ranjit Bilas Palace, accompanied by his personal staff, on the night of the 24th November, a memorable date in the annals of Ratlam State. His Highness was created a K.C.S.I. in 1909. He was present at the Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1911 and was promoted the same year to the rank of Major in the Army. In April, 1915, His Highness proceed- ed on active service in France and two months later was promoted to the Honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.

His Excellency stated further -Before laying this stone I like to say what gratification it gives me to know that Your Highness is taking much interest in the development of your State, and is showing so warm a solicitude for the welfare of your subjects."" Lord Irwin's illustrious successor, His Excellency Lord Willingdon, a little more than four years later in December, 1932, publicly declared : ""Your Highness' loyalty to the Crown and your splendid record of four years' active service on the Western Front are too well known to require any reference from me.

The State, as we know it to-day, is a part of the ancient kingdom of Kamrupa or Pragjyotish. In prehistoric ages an Aryan colony, according to Hindu legends, was established in Kamrupa by God Vishnu who made Narak its king. Bhagadatta, of Mahabharat fame, succeeded his father, Narak, and his descendants continued to rule the country up to the 12th century A.D. In the meantime many other dynasties, including the ancestors of the present Rulers of Cooch Behar, who are said to have descended from Kartabiryarjjun of the Haihaya dynasty of the Lunar Kshattriya race and lived in the Narbada Valley in Central India, migrated to, and settled at, Jalpesh near Family of Cooch Behar may be traced from the seventh century A.D.

The Abyssinians or the Habshis, who came from West Africa towards the middle of the fifteenth century, enlisted themselves at first in the military service of the Bahmani Kingdom in the Deccan. An opportunity occurred for showing their martial prowess at the downfall of the Bahmani Dynasty. In 1489 A.D. they possessed themselves of the Janjira Island and the Fort, and, having settled themselves there, began to prosper in a wondrous manner. In 1660 A.D. they were appointed Admirals of the Fleet on the western coast of India by the Moghal Emperor, Aurangzeb. The part they played in their naval contest with Shivaji and later on, working in alliance with the British, in defeating and breaking the power of the Angrias, who had established themselves as a sea-power in Konkan, forms a glorious chapter in the history of Janjira and a striking illustration of the reputation of the Abyssinians for their bravery both on land and sea. A Treaty of Alliance and Sincere Friendship was concluded between the State and the British Government in the year 1733 A.D. The State pays no tribute and owns a Dependency on the south coast of Kathiawar known as Jafarabad which also, unlike other States in Kathiawar, pays no tribute to any one.

During the Great War the State did its utmost to help the prosecution of that titanic struggle for human freedom by annually giving the amount of Rs. 8,000 for maintaining the Signalling Units SO long as the War lasted. The people in the State also freely invested in the War Loans. His Highness the Nawab Sahib Sir Sidi Ahmad Khan Bahadur, instead of going in for a loan, gave a free contribution of Rs. 50,000 towards the expenses of the War. Nearly 140 persons from the State enlisted as combatants and non- combatants. They were paid bonus by the State and provision was made by the State for the maintenance of their dependents. The services rendered by the State were highly appreciated by the British Government and, in recognition of the same, His Highness was granted the permanent privilege of enjoying a local salute of 13 guns. His Highness also received a letter from His Excellency the Governor of Bombay saying that the services rendered by His late Highness Sir Sidi Ahmad Khan would not be easily forgotten."" During the rule of His late Highness Sir Sidi Ahmad Khan the State made rapid progress in all directions. In the year 1888 A.D. enactments were passed which made provision for the constitution of Municipalities in the State and for the better administration of the Local Funds by a Board organised for the purpose. All the members were nominated till 1921 A.D. when, in order to give an effective share to the people in the administration of Local Self- Government, half the members of the body were ordered to be elected.

The President called a meeting of all the officers, pleaders and gentry of the capital town. After the Secretary had read out the object of the meeting, which was to devise ways and means to enlist the support and co-operation of the people, the President in his speech emphasised the importance of the occasion and invited all possible help by way of contributions to the Fund inasmuch as thereby they would not only be evincing their practical sense of loyalty to His Majesty the King-Emperor but would also be serving the noble cause of supplementing the laudable efforts of the State in administering medical relief to the diseased and the sick in the State. He held out the noble and inspiring example of His Highness in personally contributing a large amount. He explained to them that not less than 70% of the funds collected from the State would be returned to the State and the same would be devoted to the establishment of a travelling dispensary which would carry medical relief to the very doors of the villagers and this would be a very blessed commemoration of Their Majesties' Silver Jubilee in the State.

A rock dredger (Pawan-Kumar) has been purchased and put in operation to deepen the creek with a view to making the harbour accessible to light steamships and country crafts at high and to low tides, as well as to extend the available wharf space by reclaiming the soil beyond the creek so as constructed SO as to accommodate increased bulk of cargo traffic of the Port. relieve congestion on the wharf.

Their Among other industries in the State may be mentioned an Oil Mill, a Distemper and Paints Manu- facturing Factory, a Cotton Press, Ginning Factories, Weaving Works, Ice Factories, Tin Factories, etc., etc. The famous stone, known as the Porbandar stone, is found in the Adityana Hills, nine miles distant from Porbandar. Some of the massive and magnificent buildings at Bombay, Madras and Calcutta built of the Porbandar stone. It has a market not only all over India, Burma and Ceylon, but as far as Africa are and Arabia. Public Works at Porbandar have likewise been undertaken on a pretty big scale. Architecture is almost a hobby with His Highness. Plans of buildings to be constructed on main roads have invariably to be approved by His Highness himself. Some of the important and most majestic buildings, as well as buildings of modern style recently constructed in the town, are indicative of His Highness' excellent taste. The town electrification system also was inaugurated in the year 1923 at the hands of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay. Every village of the 105 villages which the State comprises is accessible either by metalled roads or by motor roads, the latter being particularly looked after by the Hazur Private Department. All the important villages in the State and outlying places of communication are connected with a network of telephone. Himself a scholar and a sportsman, His Highness bestows special attention on education-physical, mental and moral. New schools have been opened and every impetus is given to ensure the cultural advance of the people. With the help of liberal scholarship one of the High School students turned out an I.C.S. and another took his F.R.C.S., in England. A Science Graduate, who was given a scholarship, took his M. Sc. (Electric) and also took practical training in America. Another student was given a scholarship for special study of Economics in England and Geneva. An Arts student underwent three years' course in painting in Paris and came out successful with a high rank. One more student is prosecuting higher studies in Medicine in England. Education in the State is imparted on up-to-date method, according to recognised ideals. The Department conducts a quarterly journal known as the ""Hanuman Journal"" which has already become very popular. Sanskrit studies are also given their due share of encouragement by the establishment of Porbandar as a centre for Examination of the Sanskrit College of Benares, etc. The Boy Scouts Movement is being carried on both at the Capital and the village schools. His Highness runs a cricket team of his own. In 1932 His Highness the Maharaja Sahib led the All-India Cricket Team to England and won for himself and the team high encomium from every quarter. The M.C.C. paid a visit to Porbandar in December, 1933. The All-India Willingdon Tennis Tournament is played at Porbandar every year from 1934. The Bhavsinhji Hospital at Porbandar is the first Hospital in Kathiawar where major Surgery is performed with an electric knife. The Hirjibhai Wadia X-Ray Department was opened in the Hospital in July, 1933. The Hospital also administers Anti-rabic treatment. Maharani Shri Rupaliba Hospital for Women and Maternity Home, which is under construction, will serve as a valued addition to the medical facilities available to the womenfolk of the town. In April, 1931, the Porbandar Municipality underwent an important change. The Municipal Board of nominated members, 7 of whom are official and 8 non-official, was replaced by a Board of 20 members, 12 of whom are elected by the people, 5 are nominated by the State and 3 co-opted by the elected and nominated members. There is also elected President. It may be noted that the State has been abreast of the progressive times also in respect of social legislation. The Child Marriage Restraint Act has been in force from 1930, and an Act prohibiting smoking by juveniles, dates so far back as 1916. Tea shops in villages are prohibited and no gambling allowed in fairs. His Highness has been maintaining the State Military Force from 1923. No account of His Highness' career would be complete without mention being made of his great love and appreciation of music, both Indian and English. His Highness has made successful contributions to the compositions of European dance-music. The Silver Jubilee of his late Majesty King George V was celebrated in the Porbandar State with a great eclat. The celebrations were spread over the months of February, March, April and May, 1935, and public Durbar was held on the 6th May, 1935. Rs. 14,500 out of the gross amount of Rs. 18,305 collected for the Silver Jubilee Fund were remitted to the Central Organising Fund which in its turn remitted 70 per cent. of the amount to be devoted locally for the object for which the fund was collected. 80",SALUTE

The greater portion of the valley between the Nurbeddah and the Tapti is comprised in the Rajpipla Terri- tory. This is intercepted by hills which are a continuation of the Satpura Range. The highest peak of the Rajpipla Hills is known as Dhamanmal and is 3,000 feet above the sea-level. The State has an area of 1,5171 square miles of which nearly 650 are covered by forests contain- ing in abundance valuable timber like teak, tinas, blackwood (seesum) and kher. The forests are also very rich in bamboo. The principal rivers that water the Rajpipla lands are the Nurbeddah, its Heir-Apparent Yuvaraj Shree Rajendrasinhji.

Over 90 per cent. of the population are Hindus, the rest being Mohammadans and others. The climate of the greater portion of the State is salubrious, though slightly malarious in some of the hilly parts during the wet season. The soil on the whole is remarkably fertile, producing in abundance cotton, jawari, bajri, til and other grains and also tobacco. Cotton is the principal crop and is grown extensively.

His Highness was educated at Rajkumar College, Rajkot, of which His Highness holds the final diploma and was medal. After completing the course at Rajkot His Highness joined the Imperial Cadet Corps at Dehra Dun. The honorary rank of Captain was conferred on His Highness on the 14th October, 1919. The permanent salute of the State was raised from 11 to 13 guns and the title of the Ruler from Raja to Maharaja on the 1st January, 1921. His Highness was created a K.C.S.I. on the 1st January, 1925, and was granted the honorary rank of Major on the 8th September, 1932. He is attached to the XVI Light Cavalry. The Heir-apparent, Yuvraj Shree Rajendrasinhji, was born on the 30th March, 1912. His Highness has visited Europe several times since 1912. The Maharaja is entitled to be received and visited by the Viceroy. His Highness has achieved a wide reputation for himself both as an able and wise Ruler and as a keen sportsman. By win- ning the Derby and there- by annexing the Blue Ribband of the English Turf in 1934 His Highness achieved in the sporting world a unique fame for himself, for India and for his princely order. Even as a boy His Highness showed great skill as a sportsman, having himself ridden a horse to victory and earned reputation as a marksman when not much over 10 years of age. His Highness secured success in England on the Turf at an early stage, his horse Embargo having won the Irish Two Thousand Guineas and the Irish Derby in 1925 and the City and Suburban and the Grand Prix of Belgium in 1927. In 1934, he won the Derby with Windsor Lad and won fame through- out the Empire and earned the heartiest and personal congratulations of His Imperial Majesty the King- Emperor on his splendid victory. The same horse had already to his credit Maharaj Kumar Shree Indrajitsinhji. in the year the Chester Vase and the Newmarket States; and when he won the great classic India naturally received the news with joy and rejoicing. His Highness's colours are quite familiar to the racing public in India. He has held a prominent position for a number of years in the list of winning owners in Bombay, having topped it for two years running, viz., in 1932 and 1933. Most of the important events have been won by him in Western India. Among the outstanding horses owned by him may be mentioned Melesigenes which annexed a fabulous sum in stakes, Shipshape and hopes to do well in the coming years. Highness. The Maharaja has a nice string of horses in England at the present moment and His Highness is one of the ablest and most enlightened of rulers, and his administration during its twenty-two years has been marked by the sole purpose of promoting the welfare of his people and the advancement of his State. 84 He has travelled extensively in Europe and America and has given the full benefit of his up-to-date knowledge and experience to his subjects by a wise introduction of reforms wherever possible. He has also given special attention to hygiene and education. He has a very warm corner in his heart for his subjects, who naturally reciprocate to the fullest extent his love for them. He is most easily accessible to the humblest of his subjects, the redress of whose grievances he always makes his personal concern. In order to take his people into greater confidence and associate them with himself in administrative affairs he has brought into being a Legislative Council in the State for the last three years and the institution with a sympathetic support promises to be a great success. A few of the reforms that he has introduced in the State are :- Making all services pensionable; extension of the Survey Settlement system to every village in the State; introduction of legislation to protect the tenants of Inam villages from rack-renting and usurpation of lands by Inamdars; making Primary education free, giving Secondary and higher education at very low fees, and bestowing grants of liberal scholarships for Secondary and higher education. He has made liberal endowments for the benefit of the widows and the destitute and encouraged trade and industry by introduction of various liberal productive measures. Medical relief is given entirely free to every one and there is an excellent and well-equipped hospital in His Highness the Maharaja of Rajpipla with the President and Members of the State Legislative Assembly.

It is run on most up-to-date lines along with five more dispensaries with accommodation for indoor patients in the Taluka headquarters. A well-equipped power-house and water-works have also been installed by His Highness in the Capital to supply electricity and water to the town and neighbouring villages. As in the field of sports SO in the field of administration also, His Highness has played the game and brought distinction to his State by his enlightened and liberal policy. During his administration there has been marked progress in the development of the State and the revenue has increased from 13 lakhs of rupees to over 27 lakhs a year without resort to imposition of any tax whatsoever. Rajpipla is an essentially agricultural State. The cultivation of cotton on a large scale and improvement of its staple has brought prosperity to cultivators. Until about the year 1920 the cotton grown was of the inferior Goghari variety, the result being that the cultivators did not get an adequate return for their produce. In order to improve their lot His Highness the 85 present Maharaja introduced in the year 1919-20 legislation prohibiting people from sowing Goghari and other inferior varieties and making it obligatory on them to SOW the long-stapled variety of cotton known as "" 1027 A.L.F."" Every year the State through expert agencies selects the best seed of this kind and distributes it to the cultivators. The results and the consequent profits to the farmers are outstandingly marked. For whereas in the former years the Rajpipla Guest House, Rajpipla State. cotton fetched prices 30 to 40 rupees per candy below Broach Cotton, it now fetches 50 to 80 rupees more over Broach and is in a class with and compares most favourably with the Navsari cotton which is the best grown Indian cotton. Another great advantage to the culti- vators is that whereas in the past they had to go forty and fifty miles, and in many cases more, away from their homes into British districts to sell their cotton, they have, through the intro- Civil Hospital, Rajpipla State. duction of this measure and the success it has achieved, found a ready market at their own doors, and there is such a great demand for the superior variety of cotton that it is readily sold out, even in these days of trade depression, to the outside merchants who flock there during the cotton season. The popularity and success of this measure will be judged from the fact that the area under cotton cultivation, which was somewhere between sixty and seventy thousand acres before the year 1919, has increased by leaps and bounds, and is for the last six or seven years in the 86 of which vicinity has affected 1,40,000 cotton acres, more and has than remained any other at commodity. that figure even in the times of general depression, This Whereas before activity the introduction in cotton of has the had long-stapled a most wholesome variety of effect cotton on there trade were and industry only two generally. ginning factories and no cotton press, there now exist eleven ginning factories and three cotton presses, all work- ing at a considerable profit to their owners. Encour- aged by these good results, the starting of a spinning and weaving mill in the State is being comtemplated and there are offers from several companies to launch a project. The country is not lacking in mineral resources. As already mentioned, the Cornelian or Agate Mines of the State are known from the time of Ptolemy. Early in the sixteenth century an Abyssinian mer- chant named Bawaghor is known to have established a cornelian factory at Limbodra. This Sidi mer- chant, while wandering from place to place on pil- grimage, did business in precious stones and, becoming skilled in agates, set up a factory at Limbodra where he prospered and died rich. A shrine was raised in his honour on a hill close to the Cornelian mines now well known as the Bawaghor Hills in the Ratanpur Forest of this State. A fair of very great importance is held there every year. Negotiations are in progress with some well-known firms to work the mines on a scientific basis. These have been handicapped, how- ever, in the general trade depression and by the fact that cheap foreign articles made from artificial stones are abundant in the market. With improved econo- mic conditions it is hoped to work this industry on H.

Marble of good quality is to be found in the Gardeshwar Taluka of this State. It is usually black in colour and takes very good polish. Marble in white and in grayish and greenish tints is also occasionally found. There is excellent building stone near Jhagadia, in the Kadia Dungar and Bardaria Hills. The stone is grayish white and rather on the hard side. It takes a good polish and is suitable for carving. The proper working of these quarries had been handicapped up till now by the difficulty of transport, but it is now being overcome by the construction of a light railway and it is hoped that this building stone will secure a good market. Red and yellow ochre and fire and pottery clays are also found in abundance and recently a factory for pottery works and tiles has been established at Jhagadia. Cement stones and good lime stones and gypsum are also found in large quantity in the State. With a view to the development of the State His Highness has been devoting much attention to the construction of railways and roads. Rajpipla town, the Capital, is connected with Ankleshwar (in the Broach District), on the B. B. and C. I. Railway, by the Rajpipla State 87 Railway, 40 miles in length and belonging to the State. His Highness has also constructed another railway from Jhagadia Station on the R. S. Railway, about twenty miles in length, ing up the forest area and the uncultivated tracts of land. A branch of this line is running open- to the stone quarries of Kadia Dungar. It is proposed to extend this line to Dediapada, a length up of another 20 miles, in the near future and ultimately to carry it through to the extreme south- easterly boundary of the State, joining the British District of Khandesh. The State is traversed all over by a network of metalled and unmetalled fair-weather but motorable roads. New roads are being constructed continuously by up-to-date machinery like the caterpillar tractor and grader. There are about a hundred miles of metalled roads and High School, Rajpipla State. nearly four hundred miles of unmetalled roads, not to mention the inter-village roads which are all motorable. A recent achievement in this direction is the construction of a hill road-motorable during fair weather-to the famous shrine of Sulpaban, referred to as Sarban by Ptolemy. Surveys have been made for hydro-electric schemes for agricultural and electric power purposes both on the river Nurbeddah at four different sites where the territories on both the banks belong to the State and on the river Karjan. Where tracts of land are being deforested and given out for cultivation, charcoal burning is done on a very large scale. The product is exported in large quantities to the adjoining British districts and Kathiawar. Katha or catechu is prepared on a moderate scale from kher trees. Bamboo mats and other articles are made on a considerable scale by Bhils and other people living in and round the forests. Special facilities are given to them by the State for the purpose. In During the Great War His Highness rendered valuable services to the Crown. addition to contributions in men and money which amounted to over Rs. 10 lakhs, His High- In ness made a gift of an aeroplane, which rendered conspicuous services on the Western Front. the hereditary title of Maharaja was bestowed upon the Ruler of this State, and the permanent con- recognition of his loyalty to the Crown and his War services as well as of his wise administration dynastic salute was raised from 11 to 13 guns. The further distinction of K.C.S.I. was also ferred on His Highness in 1925. 88",SALUTE
47,Sirmoor,"THE STATE OF SIRMOOR embraces an area of about 1,200 square miles, yielding an annual income of about twelve lakhs of rupees. The early history of the State is interwoven with legend from the time of Raja Madan Singh who flourished about nine hundred years ago. This Raja, as is borne out by Tod's ""Rajisthan,"" descended from Salbahan 1st, the Rawal of Jaiselmere, and was therefore a Jadu, i.e., a with all its inhabitants including the Raja and his household. The town of Sirmoor being thus Chandra Bansi Rajput. During his reign a flood in the Giri river engulfed the town of Sirmoor subverted, the State was for some time left without a ruler. Salbahan 2nd, Rawal of Jaiselmere, Rai happened to be in the neighbourhood of Sirmoor about the time and he was approached by a The Bhat, or bard, with a request to send one of his Raj Kumars to ascend the vacant gaddi. Rani who was pregnant, set off for Sirmoor. But he died en route at Sarhind. The Rani, notwithstand- she Rawal acceded to this request and accordingly his third son, Hasu, accompanied by his ing her overwhelming grief, continued the journey and on arrival at Poka, near Sirmoor Tal, the birth to a son who was readily acknowledged by the people as their future Raja, and of gave Rani, at their earnest solicitations, consented to stay in the country. The present Maharaja Sirmoor claims his descent from this very prince. The dynastic table contains a long list of forty-six Rulers and the space at our command account would hardly permit of any attempt at full description of each of them. However, a brief of some more prominent of them is given in the following lines:- Raja in 1256 A. D.

He established Police, Judicial and Revenue Offices. Courts, District Boards and Public Works Department, Schools, Dispensaries and began cultivation of Kiarda Dun which had previously been a wild and unproductive tract Post the He constructed roads, provided for regular Land Settlement, preserved Forests and of land. He rendered efficient help to the Government during the Mutiny of 1857. During the Viceroyalty of Lord Lytton he was appointed a member of the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1876 he received the distinction of K.C.S.I. and in 1886 was made a G.C.S.I. His long reign of more than forty-two years was distinguished by remarkable devotion to the welfare of the State and his subjects. He was unwearied in his endeavours to inaugurate measures of reform. He was succeeded by Raja Surendra Bikram Parkash in 1898. His education in general in scholastic studies was of a high order and during the last two years of his father's reign he became thoroughly acquainted with the duties of State management. His loyalty to the British Crown was never doubted and in recognition of this fact and of his wise administration he was honoured by being made a K.C.S.I. in 1901 and a member of the Legislative Council in 1902. He died in 1911 and was succeeded by his son Maharaja Sir Amar Parkash Bahadur, the illustrious father of the present Ruler. Lt.-Col. His Highness Maharaja Sir Amar Prakash Bahadur, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., was born on the 26th January, 1887, and succeeded his father, Raja Sir Surendra Bikram Prakash Bahadur, K.C.S.I., in 1911. He took a keen and lively interest in the administration of the State and was passionately devoted to the welfare and prosperity of his subjects. When a young prince he had acquired sufficient knowledge of Persian and English under the tutorage of some eminent men of letters and commanded a fluent style of English. After finishing literary education he made himself practically conversant with the working of the State during his father's illness. Thus he had acquired all the administrative qualifications desirable in a Ruling Chief and all through his reign admirably discharged the heavy and multifarious duties and responsibilities attached to his high rank. He embraced every opportunity of inaugurating reforms calculated to improve the welfare of his subjects, one of the most important of these being grant of free primary education throughout the State in commemoration of his installation. He had also provided a spacious hostel called after his name, the Amar Boarding House,"" for students. Another event of note which distinguished his reign was the accomplishment of the pet project of his father regarding waterworks. He thus supplied the town of Nahan with water at a great expense. The addition of ""Amar Block"" to the High School Buildings afforded increased facilities in the matter of education. He also had the Kala Amb Road metalled at a considerable cost. This has greatly added to the convenience of traffic and is sure to pave the way towards commercial development. Like his father he was also untiring in his efforts to govern the State on the lines of the British Government. In recognition of his excellent management of the State, goodwill towards his subjects, and loyalty to the British Government he was invested with the title of K.C.S.I. in 1915. In 1918 the personal rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and the hereditary title of Maharaja were granted to him by the benign Government. Like his forefathers the Maharaja in 1921. was thoroughly faithful to the Crown and was loved by his subjects. He was created a K.C.I.E. In 1914 he evinced his traditional loyalty to the Government by offering his personal services in connection with the Great War in addition to placing the entire resources of his State 91 at the disposal of the Government. In the same year he sent the Sirmoor Sappers and Minors to Mesopotamia to help the Government, and when this corps, like other troops, was besieged and taken prisoner at Kut in the loyal and heroic discharge of its duty, a second Company was organised and sent on active service which returned triumphantly after subduing the enemy. Over and above this he made over the State Bungalow at Dehra Dun for the use of War Hospital and the Bantony Cottage at Simla for that of the Military Department. His Highness contributed Rs. 2,36,000 to the Imperial Indian Relief Fund and Rs. 2,00,000 (two lacs) to the War Loan in addition to various other big donations too numerous to detail. His Highness the Maharaja had thoroughly endeared himself to his subjects and was ever anxious to follow with interest all that conduced to their general happiness and prosperity. He died in Vienna on the 13th August, 1933, after a brilliant and beneficient reign of more than 21 years. His sad and sorrowful demise, while depriving his son, His Highness Maharaja Rajendra Prakash Bahadur, of the solicitious and effectionate care of his father, placed the heavy and responsible burden of the administration of the State on his shoulders while he was still in the early years of his life. His Highness Maharaja Rajendra Prakash Bahadur was born on the 10th January, 1913. He was carefully educated during the lifetime of his father who took special interest in the upbringing of his son. During his father's absence in Europe, when the administration of the State was placed in the hands of a Council, he got practical training in, and gained immense knowledge of, the ins and outs of administration and thereby had efficiently equipped himself for the responsibilities of his high office. In recognition of his merits and abilities the Maharaja was installed to his ancestral gaddi, before due time, by the Hon'ble Sir J.A.C. Fitzpatrick, K.C.I.E., O.B.E., I.C.S., Agent to the Governor-General, Punjab States, in November, 1933. The young Prince is a good scholar in English and has a store of wisdom far beyond his years. He is energetic and intelligent and is a keen sportsman. He possesses very refined tastes and a sympathetic heart and is a lover of justice. As the Chief Justice of the State High Court he considers it his solemn obligation to dispense even-handed justice with scrupulous care. Ever since his ascension to the gaddi he has been administering the State with conspicuous ability without sparing any pains to promote the interests of his State and subjects. He is ever anxious to explore new avenues and examine fresh channels which would serve to raise the moral and material status of his people and country. For the revival of the agricultural and industrial interests of his subjects the inaugural ceremony of the Exhibition was performed by His Highness the Maharaja on the auspicious occasion of the Raj Tilak celebrated in February 1935. A similar Exhibition used to be run on organised lines during the regime of His late Highness Maharaja Sir Surendra Bikram Prakash Bahadur, K.C.S.I,, and continued successfully during the reign of H. H. the late Maharaja Sir Amar Parkash Bahadur, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., but it had suffered a set-back in the year 1914 owing to the outbreak of the Great War and also due to the un- favourable agricultural conditions then obtaining. The measure taken by the present Maharaja is sure to pave the way to commercial development of the State and prove a success under the patronage of His Highness to whose munificence it owes its origin. Another event which marks His Highness' ascension to his ancestral gaddi is the grant of certain concessions to his subjects which include-(1) remission of land revenue and forest out- standings up to the year 1932, (2) remission in the terms of imprisonment of the State convicts, (3) grants-in-aid for meeting the educational needs of the people, (4) provision of the gymnasium for use of the public, (5) introduction of the Panchayat system, etc., etc. His Highness is accessible to all and is fond of undertaking extensive tours with a view to study the conditions of his people and keep himself informed of the march of events in the State. He takes a keen personal interest in all that conduces to the general happiness and welfare of his people. His sterling and outstanding qualities of head and heart have won for him the affection of his faithful and loyal people. In fact the young Maharaja during the short period that has passed since his investiture with full ruling powers has proved himself to be a very promising and enlightened Ruler and gives every promise of proving himself a worthy successor of his illustrious father. His Highness married in April, 1936, a Princess of the Ruling Family of Nagod State in Central India. 92",SALUTE

The State is picturesquely situated on both banks of the Sutlej river, in a tract where the river, breaking away from the middle ranges, treads its way through the valleys of the lower hills. It is bounded on the north by the States of Mangal, Suket and Mandi, on the west by the districts of Kangra and Hoshiarpur, on the south by the Nalagarh State and on the east by the Baghal State. The area of the State is 448 square miles and the population (1931 Census) 100,994. It has a revenue of about three lakhs. This old and historic State was founded over twelve hundred years ago by Bir Chand, the eldest son of Raja Hari Har Chand, seventieth in descent from the Rajput rulers of Chanderi in Gwalior. In 754 Bikrami he accompanied his father to Bilaspur, along with his three younger brothers-Ghambir Chand, Kubir Chand and Sabir Chand-to pay a visit to the memorial erected by Raja Jai Dev in honour of his pious father, Eldev, who passed away at Bilaspur while engaged in worship. From here they procceeded on pilgrimage to Jawalamukhi. At Nadaun military games resulted in a fight against the Kangra Chief, in which Raja Hari Har Chand and his youngest son, Sabir Chand, were slain. The remaining three sons then entered upon a career of conquests. The eldest, Bir Chand, founded the State of Bilaspur; Ghambir Chand took possession of Chanahan in Jammu, while Kabir Chand carved out a principality in Kumayun. Raja Bir Chand erected a fort at Kot Kehlur and the State therefrom came to be known also as Kehlur. By and by, he brought under his suzerainty the twelve Hill Thakrais, such as Baghal, Nehra, Beja, Dhami, Keonthal, Kuthar, Jubbal, Baghat, Ghanyar, Ghumarsen, Bhajji and Mahlog, which had to pay tributes to him. Peace was made with the Sirmoor State after a stubborn fight and after handing over Jubbal to that State. Gurakh Garhi was fixed as a boundary between the two States. In 1156 Bikrami, Raja Khan Chand, 11th in descent from Bir Chand, divided His Highness Raja Anand Chand Bahadur, Bilaspur State (Simla Hills) the State between his two sons, the Ilaqa of Kehlur being allotted to the elder, Ajit Chand, while that of Handur to the younger, Sujit Singh. The year 1277 Bikrami is memorable in the history of the State on account of a revolution started and conducted by the Kunaits with such irresistible vigour as to result in the utter discomfiture of Raja Megh Chand and his voluntary banishment to Kulu. He was, however, reinstated to the gaddi by a King of Delhi of the Sayyad Dynasty. A century later the State gained considerably in power and prosperity through a heroic exploit of Raja Ratan Chand, twenty-third in descent from Raja Bir Chand, In 1412 Bikrami he went to Delhi for an interview with the King. During a ramble a tiger attacked the King but was in turn killed by the sword of the Raja. The King granted him a khillat of sword and a cash reward of one lakh and twenty thousand rupees and further made him an overlord of as many as tweny-two Rajas of the hills, with an authority to levy tribute from Kulu, Kangra, Kutlehar, Mandi, Suket, Chamba, Jaswan, Datarpur, Guler, Nurpur and Siba on the left side of the Ravi and Jammu, Jasrota, Bhadu, Bhatwal, Bhadarwa, Chanahan, Samba, Bandral, Kishtwar, Mankot and Basohli on the right side of the river.

He conquered Bushehr State to help the Raja of Kulu and made him his also a great part of his territory. He conquered the Sikandra range from Suket State and gave it to maternal uncle Sidhsain of Mandi State. Raja Mahan Chand, thirty-eighth in descent, was installed on the gaddi in 1835 Bikrami at the age of three. Due to his weak rule the twelve subordinate Thakrais were conquered by Raja Ram Singh of Nalagarh and the Ilaqa of Jandauri, Hathawat and the Kot range were snatched by the Sikhs. After some time the twelve Hill States came into his possession again with the help of the Gurkhas. But subsequently the Gurkha leader, Amar Singh Thapa, brought under his control nine of them, leaving to the Raja only Bhajji, Dhami and Koti States. On the 8th February, 1815 A. D., after the defeat of the Gurkhas at the hands of the British, a treaty was made between Raja Mahan Chand and General Ochterlony by which the Raja was to help the British in time of war and the British Government was not to levy any tribute from the State. In 1847 Raja Jagat Chand was granted a Sanad from the British Government authorising him to possess the Ilaqa on the right side of the river Sutlej, then under the control of the Sikhs. Raja Jagat Chand expelled the Sikhs from Jandauri and Kot Dhar at the instance of Mr. Arskin, Superintendent of the Simla Hill States. Kot Dhar was, however, granted as a life Jagir to Sardar Lehna Singh but was restored to Raja Hira Chand on his promise of paying an annual tribute of eight thousand rupees. The Jandari Pargana was annexed by the British Government after the fall of the Sikh Government. For services rendered during the Mutiny, Raja Hira Chand was granted a salute of 9 guns, subsequently raised to 11. Raja Sir Bije Chand, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., forty-third in descent, succeeded his father, Raja Amarchand, in 1889 A.D., being then about sixteen years of age. On the outbreak of the Great European War he offered his personal services and the resources of his State unreservedly to Government. His War services were recognised in 1917 by the conferment of the title of K.C.I.E. The State was also transferred from the Political control of the Superintendent, Hill States, Simla, on the 1st November 1921. Further a Sanad conferring the power of capital sentence was conferred on the Ruler of the State by the Government of India in 1922. In November 1927, due to weak health, he abdicated in favour of his worthy son, the present Raja Sahib. He breathed his last in Benares in 1931. The Present Ruler. His Highness Raja Anand Chand Bahadur was born on the 26th January, 1913. He was educated in the Mayo College, Ajmer, and passed his Post-diploma Course in March 1931, standing first in the class. During his minority the administration of the State was carried on by the Council of Administration from November, 1927, to January, 1933, when he was invested with full Ruling Powers. His Highness was married to the daughter of the Raja Rana of Jubbal State in 1931 and was blessed with an heir-apparent on the 2nd September 1935. His Highness, who is almost an intellectual prodigy, is very keen in bringing the State Administration to the highest level of efficiency on the most up-to-date lines and, with this end in view, pays his personal attention to all the affairs of the State. To quote a few instances, Sir Bije War Memorial Hospital for Women has been opened in a splendid building built at a great cost, a motorable road is being constructed and an Improvement Committee has been formed to devise means for the improvement of agriculture and the development of the economic resources of the State. It is hoped that the State will, within a few years, attain perfection in all respects under the rule of this progressive and enlightened Prince. His Highness the Raja Sahib is a member of the Chamber of Princes and is also entitled to be received by His Excellency the Viceroy. The Jubilee. Due to the sad demise of the Dowager Rani Sahiba Baghliani, the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Their Majesties in the Bilaspur State were postponed till the 17th and 18th May 1935. The happy and auspicious event was celebrated with great eclat in the Sandhu field at Bilaspur. The programme included a parade of troops, hoisting of the Union Jack, Thanksgiving service, Military and School boys' Sports and a Durbar in which Silver Jubilee Medals were awarded to some of the State officers by His Highness the Raja Sahib. The town and the public buildings, which were tastefully decorated with pictures and buntings, were illuminated on the night of the 17th May and bonfires on the high mountain peaks presented a singularly picturesque and imposing sight. On the same night a State Banquet was given. The celebrations ended on the 18th May with a tea party given by His Highness. Contributions.

55,Cambay,"HIS HIGHNESS NAJUM-UD-DAULAH MUMTAZ-UL-MULK MOMIN KHAN BAHADUR DILAVARJUNG NAWAB MIRZA HUSAIN YAVERKHAN BAHADUR is the Ruler of Cambay, a first-class State in the Gujarat States Agency with powers to try capital offences. The area of the State is 392 square miles, population 87,761 and the annual revenue about 9 to 10 lakhs. The Ruler is entitled to be received and visited by the Viceroy and the Governor of Bombay and to a salute of 11 guns. The State is situated to the west of Gujarat at the head of the Gulf of Cambay. It is bounded on the north by the District of Kaira; on the east by Kaira and Baroda; on the south by the Mahi river and the Gulf of Cambay; and on the west by the Sabarmati river, separating it from Ahmedabad. The boundaries of the State are very irregular; some villages belonging to the Gaekwar of Baroda and to the British Government are entirely surrounded by Cambay territory, while Cambay villages are found in Kaira District. The country is flat and open, interspersed here and there, generally in the vicinity of the villages, with groves of fine trees, such as the mango, tamarind, banyan or bar, nim and pipal. From the position of the State between the Sabarmati and Mahi, both of which are tidal rivers, the soil is SO soaked with salt that the water becomes brackish at a little distance below the surface. The climate is equable, the minimum and maximum temperature being 46Â° and 118Â° respectively. The annual rainfall averages 28.7 inches. Its situation to the coast makes it an important centre of trade. But its importance as a port has been declining owing principally to the silting up of the Gulf of Cambay; strenuous efforts are, however, being made by the State to develop the port in the interest of the trade and industries of the State. The name of Cambay is said to be derived from Stambha-tirth, or Khamba, the pool of Mahadeo in the form of pillar of God. Cambay is mentioned by Massaudi (913). Of the population of the State, Hindus form 81 per cent. of the total, Mussalmans 12 per cent, Jains 4 per cent and others 3 per cent. The only important town is Cambay with a population of 31,877 souls. About two-thirds of the population of the State is supported by agriculture, but there is some trade in manufactured articles, e.g., cloth, carpets, embroideries and carved cornelians. According to Lieutenant Robertson's ""Historical Narrative of Cambay,"" the Parsis of Gujarat sailed from Persia about the end of the seventh or beginning of the eighth century. A great number of their ships foundered in a storm, and only a few arrived at Sanjan about 70 miles south of Surat. They obtained permission to land after some difficulty, and on certain conditions, the chief of which were that they should speak the Gujarati language and abstain from beef. The Parsis remained for many years in the vicinity of Sanjan, pursuing a coasting trade, but eventually they spread over the neighbouring districts, and became SO numerous at Cambay that they outnumbered the original inhabitants and took possession of the town. After a short period, they were driven out by the Hindus, who held the territory until conquered by the Mohammadans in 1298. Politically it passed from the hands of the Anhilwada Kings into those of the Vaghalas, from whom it passed into the hands of the agents of the Moghul Emperors of Delhi in 1304. Therefore, the history of Cambay divides itself into three parts-the early part lasting till 1304 when the Mohammadans finally conquered Anhilwada; the middle part from 1300 to 1730 when Cambay formed part of the Mussalman Kingdom of the Province of Gujarat; and the modern period from 1730 when Cambay became a distinct State. Notwithstanding the uncertainties resulting from conflicting interests of different powers claiming suzerainty over it, Cambay successfully maintained its quasi-independence until it passed under the suzerainty of the British by the treaty of Bassein in 1802. Early in the seventeenth century, the Dutch and the British had established their factories in Cambay. It is a very ancient town and during the 11th and 12th centuries was one of the chief ports of Gujarat and at the time of the conquest of Gujarat by Mussalmans 102 in 1297 it was said to have been one of the richest towns in India. Cambay was often harassed with Major Walker in 1802 to oppose the progress of Mulhar Rao of Kadi. The then Nawab of by the Mahrattas who laid waste the city in ruins until Governor Duncan landed at Cambay Cambay rendered timely service to the Governor who appointed a British Resident at the Court of Cambay. That arrangement was altered in 1818 and the Resident was withdrawn and the State was put under the political control of the Collector of Kaira. Again in 1933 the State was transferred to the political control of the Agent to the Governor-General, Gujarat States, and the Resident at Baroda. The founder of the Ruling family of Cambay was Mirza Jafar Najm-e-Sani, better known as Momin Khan, one of the last Mohammadan Governors of Gujarat.

56,Chamba,"CHAMBA is one of the oldest Indian States, having been founded in the middle of the sixth century A.D. of The Rulers are Rajputs of the solar race. The first Raja was Marut, a descendant Kus, the younger son of Rama, and the original capital was at Brahmaur (ancient Brahmapura) in the Upper Ravi Valley. About A. D. 900, Raja Sahil Varma conquered the Lower Ravi Valley from the petty hill barons-called Ranas and Thakurs-who were the original Rulers of the hills and changed his capital from Brahmaur to Chamba, originally called Champa. From it the State received the present name. Chamba is several times referred to in the ""Rajatarangini,"" an ancient History of Kashmir, to which country it was subject for several centuries. After the Mohammadan invasions began, it became independent and remained SO till the time of Akbar when it came under Moghal control. The loyalty of the Chamba Chiefs won for them generous treatment under the later Emperors, and one of them, Prithvi Singh, enjoyed a mansab (military rank) in the Moghal Army- Valuable jagirs and other personal gifts were also conferred upon them, some of which are still in the possession of the State. Chamba is several times referred to by Mohammadan historians. On the decline of the Moghal Empire and the transfer of the Punjab to the Durrani Rulers of Kabul in 1752, Chamba, along with the other Hill States, came under their control, and then again under that of the Sikhs from about 1770, and also that of Raja Sansar Chand of Kangra in 1786. Finally, in 1809, the supremacy passed into the hands of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, on his acquisition of the Kangra Fort. Chamba State was much larger in former times than now as it held the whole southern fringe of the Dhaula Dhar range far as Bir Banghal, now in Kangra, and also the two districts of Bhadrawah and Padar, now in Jammu. In 1847, after the first Sikh War, the State came under British control. It now contains 50 small sub-divisions, called parganas or ilaqas, each under its own staff of officials, and the head of each, called Char, bears a title once in use all over Northern India, and now found only in Chamba. The area of the State is 3,127 square miles, wholly mountainous, and the population at the census of 1931 was 1,46,872. The average annual revenue is Rs. 8,87,000. The scenery throughout the State, and especially in the Chenab Valley (called Pangi), is unsurpassed for beauty and grandeur. Of later Rulers the most distinguished were Raja Umed Singh (1748-64), Raja Raj Singh (1764-94) who was killed in the battle at Nerti in Kangra, and Raja Charhat Singh who died in 1843. Raja Sri Singh ruled from 1843 to 1870, and was followed by his brother, Raja Gopal Singh, who abdicated in 1873 in favour of his elder son, Raja Sham Singh. The last-named did much to embellish the capital, as well as to open the State by the construction of good roads. Raja Sir Bhuri Singh (1904-19), grandfather of the present Ruler, continued this work and, among other improvements, provided an electric installation and a good pipe-water supply to the town. He was an enlightened and sympathetic Ruler and his distinguished services during the Great War won for him the distinctions of K.C.S.I. and K.C.I.E. from Government. His worthy son, Raja Ram Singh, ruled from 1919 to 1935 with remarkable ability and wisdom. He was assiduous in promoting measures for the welfare of his subjects and gave special attention to the improvement of communications, sanitation, medical arrangements, extension of educational facilities, and postal service. The present Ruler, Raja Lakshman Singh, was born on the 8th December, 1924, and succeeded to the gaddi on the death of his father, Raja Ram Singh, on the 7th December, 1935. As he is a minor the Administration of the State is being conducted by a Council, consisting of President (Colonel H. S. Strong, C.I.E.), Vice-President and Chief Secretary (Dewan Bahadur L. Madho Ram), and a Judicial Member (Lala Rala Ram). The Raja is receiving his education at the Aitchison Chiefs' College, Lahore. During the Great War the State served the Empire with exemplary devotion. The Royal Silver Jubilee in May, 1935, was celebrated in the State with great eclat. On the 6th, after the Royal salute, there was a Durbar, attended by State officials and prominent guests from outside, where Silver Jubilee Medals and Sanads were presented by His Highness to Civil and Military officers. Special devotional services were held in all principal places of worship. In the evening the town was brilliantly illuminated and there was a display of bonfires on the surrounding hills.

The Jadejas have contributed not a few brilliant is quite in keeping the traditions of the race. Those traditions are to-day ennobled by the chapters in the history with of the Kathiawar Peninsula and the contribution of Morvi to that history benevolent and enlightened rule of Maharaja Shri Lukhdhirji. The State of Morvi lies in the northern half of Kathiawar with an excellent harbour in the Inner Gulf of Cutch, with part of Runn of Cutch within its territories and with a district in the Peninsula of Cutch itself, embracing in all nearly 900 square miles with a population of over 1,13,000 souls against 96,097 in the previous decade. Thanks to wise and efficient administration, the annual income of the State has increased during the last fifty years from eight lakhs to well-nigh over fifty lakhs in spite of the fact that taxation in the State is lighter than perhaps anywhere else. The Ruler is entitled to be received and visited by the Viceroy and to a salute of 11 guns. The Capital town, Morvi, is one of the oldest towns in Kathiawar boasting a continuous existence as headquarters of either a Ruling Prince himself or his Suba ruling over the Machhukantha Division of Kathiawar. This Division is so called because it lies on the banks of the Machhu, one of the largest rivers in Kathiawar. The Morvi town ranks next only to Junagadh in its unbroken historical importance. The town was a flourishing Capital of the Machhukantha Division as far back as 900 A. D., and even at that early date the town had advanced to an important position as shown by the copper-plate found at Morvi dated Samvat 585 of the Gupta period, i.e., approximately 905 A. D. The history of the present Ruling House of Morvi takes us back to the Mahabharat period of India's ancient history. For the Yuvraj Shri Mahendrasinhji, Heir-Apparent Jadeja clan of Rajputs, to which the Rulers of Morvi belong, are of Morvi. descended from one of the Yadavs who survived the holocaust at Veraval Patan in the time of Lord Krishna. These survivors of the family of Lord Krishna left Kathiawar and are said to have migrated to Sind and even to Kandhar in Afghanistan. Some of them migrated from Sind to Cutch, captured it and established themselves there about the year 1300 A. D. They soon entered Kathiawar and penetrated as far south as Ghumli, the then Capital of Jethwas of the Porbandar House, and reduced the fort in 1313 A. D. Since then the Jadejas ruled supreme in Cutch and steadily brought the northern portion of the Kathiawar Peninsula under their sway. To-day a larger portion of Kathiawar is ruled by the various Jadeja Houses than by any other clan of Rajputs or Mohammadans in the Peninsula. Morvi was ruled by the Jethwa Rajputs until the fifteenth century when the territory passed to the Sultans of Ahmedabad. In 1698 A.D. Morvi was captured by Rao Rawaji, the second son of the then Ruling Prince of Cutch, Rao Raidhanji. On Rao Raidhanji's eldest son Noughanji predeceasing him, Rawaji became the rightful heir to the Gaddi of Cutch. But he was murdered by his nephew, Gorji, whose father Pragmalji, the third son of Rao youthful son of the murdered Rawaji. Kayaji eventually wrested Raidhanji, usurped the Gaddi, refusing the right of Kayaji, the Maharaj Kumar Shri Kalika Kumar of Morvi.

His Highness himself looks into every little detail in every one of the departments of the State administration and his grasp of things is remarkable. Under his able and sympathetic guidance the State has been progressing remarkably in all directions. Backbone of the State.-Recognising clearly that the agriculturists are the backbone of the State, the Maharaja has paid earnest attention to the promotion The Willingdon Secretariat, Morvi. of their welfare and prosperity. The cultivators are enabled to acquire permanent occupancy rights on payment of a small fee, and the assessment has been SO fixed as to secure their content- ment. For their benefit an Agricultural Bank has been established which is doing splendid work. Moreover, a new department has been opened to bring all the uncultivated land under the plough by protective works, such as bunds and reclamation, and by the sinking of new wells and the deepening of old ones; by repairing tanks and extending irrigation schemes. In addition, a sum of Rvs. 25 lakhs has been set apart as a Special Famine Insurance Fund to ensure the welfare of the agriculturists during famine. Between 1922 and 1936 the remission of land revenue sanctioned by the Maharaja amounted to over 30 lakhs. In addition to such generous remissions, His Highness ordered the entire peasants' debt of about 10 lakhs due to the State previous to His Highness' accession to the Gaddi to be written off. Recently His Highness announced another block of debts to be written off and took the unprecedented step of returning the mortgaged lands to the debtors which, in the ordinary course, would never have reverted to them because of their indebtedness. Besides remissions like this, His Highness has recently created a trust fund of no less than 17 lakhs of rupees, the income from which will be spent on several philanthropic and charitable works like rural uplift, etc., touching practically every individual in the State. In view of the fact that in this State cotton is the principal crop, the Morvi Government has taken steps to establish a number of ginning and pressing factories, thus substantially reducing the cost of cartage and labour to the agriculturists for their cotton. Public Works.-The Morvi Government have spent between 1922 and 1936 over Rs. 53 lakhs on public works and water supply. Six lakhs of rupees have been expended on the Boring Department alone, which was opened in 1925. The total number of wells bored is 500, of which 400 have been designed purely for agricultural purposes. Telephone.-Sixty-three villages in the State are connected by telephone with Morvi, the Capital. The use of the telephone is not restricted to State officers only; the public also are permitted its use. In summoning medical aid from the Capital to those living in remote villages as also in the administrative work the telephone has been extremely useful. 112 Hospital Medical for Services.- Women (Maharani The State maintains at Morvi a general hospital (Sir Waghji Hospital) and a and Shree Nundkunverba addition there districts. is a City Dispensary a Red Cross Centre.

The State Council hears appeals and revision applications. Both in criminal cases and civil suits the State Council is the highest court of appeal. Subordinate to the State Council there are four courts of Civil Justice. Roads and Railway.-No State of comparable size and revenue has paid SO much atten- tion as Morvi to the improvement of roads and means of communication. Within the State there is a net-work of tramways covering a length of nearly 65 miles. There are about 500 miles of motor roads. The State is the sole owner of the Morvi Railway which was opened in 1886. Since then the original railway line has been extended. To-day the railway line is 132 miles long. The net earnings on the railway show a return of about 8 per cent. on the capital outlay which is well over a crore of rupees. Port of Navlakhi.-For several hundred years the Port of Wawania was one of the chief ports on the coast of Kathiawar in the Inner Gulf of Cutch. But some silting was noticed there and as His late Highness Sir Waghji Bahadur very much desired to expand the sea-borne trade of the State, His Highness, with great foresight, selected in 1901-02 the site of the present Port of Navlakhi, and spent about 9 lakhs of rupees in reclaiming land out of the swamps and marshes, in building a pier, and in constructing a tramway line between Morvi and Navlakhi, a distance of 30 miles. Navlakhi is situated about 19 miles up the Hansthal Creek in the Inner Gulf of Cutch. It is by far the safest natural harbour on the coast of Kathiawar. The bed of the creek is not at all rocky. Ships with a draft of 30 feet or under can enter the harbour at high tide and anchor dozen within two miles of the shore. The anchorage area is large enough to accommodate half a monsoon it is possible to work ships all the twenty-four hours. This is a unique advantage ocean-going ships at a time.

In 1849 a Sanad was granted to the Nawab of the day, confirming the jagir to him free of any demand, with authority, subject to certain conditions, to manage the revenue and the police and to administer civil justice. In 1862 another Sanad, under the hand of Earl Canning, conveyed the promise that the Government would permit and confirm any succession to the State which might be legitimate according to Mohammadan Law. In 1870, on the occasion of the visit of His Royal Highness the then Prince of Wales, the title of Nawab was bestowed on the Chief as an hereditary distinction. In 1905 the administration of the State was temporarily assumed by the Government of Madras on the ground that the then Nawab, Saiyed Fateh Ali, C.S.I., had involved himself deeply in debt, disregarded the advice of the Madras Government and obstructed reforms. Saiyed Fateh Ali died in 1906. The administration was handed over to his son, Saiyed Ghulam-i-Ali. Saiyed Ghulam-i-Ali died in 1922 and was succeeded by his eldest son, the present Nawab Saiyed Fazl-i-Ali Khan.

85,Kalahandi,"THE STATE OF KALAHANDI or Karond, in the Eastern States Agency, is 3,745 square miles in area with a population of 5,13,716 and an annual income of 6 lakhs and a half. It includes five big Zamindaries which invest the Ruler of the State with special dignity. The State borders upon the Madras Presidency, the Central Provinces, Orissa and other sister States and there are roads which connect the State with the neighbouring territories. These roads are well built and well kept and some of them are passable throughout the year. The capital of the State is linked with the nearest Railway Station by a very good road motorable all the year round. For the facility of communication there are telephone connections between important stations and further extension has been carried on. Kalahandi was once an independent State paying no tribute to any power, but eventually came under the dominion of the Marhattas. It was not one of the Garjat States which composed the cluster under Patna and Sambalpur but was a tributary Chieftainship owing formally allegiance to the reigning Marhatta family of Nagpur. When the Province of Nagpur lapsed to the British Crown in 1853 the State of Kalahandi came under the jurisdiction of the British Government and was subsequently created a Feudatory State. It was in political relations with the Government of C.P. till 1905, when such relation was transferred to the Government of Bihar and Orissa. It is now in direct political relationship with the Government of India through the Agent to the Governor-General, Eastern States Agency. The present Ruler of the State, Maharaja Braja Mohan Deo, O.B.E., was born on the 14th of May, 1896, and is the 30th Chief in the line of succession. He succeeded his father, Raja Raghu Kesari Deo, and to the gaddi on the 20th of October, 1897. He was educated at the Rajkumar College, Raipur, married the daughter of Raja Sachidananda Tribhuban Deb of Bamra State in 1916 and was invested with full ruling powers on the 15th September, 1917. He was formally installed on the 19th January, 1918. The House of Kalahandi is noted for its loyalty to the British Crown. The grandfather of the present Ruler, Raja Uditpratap Deo, attended the Delhi Darbar in 1877 and, in addition to his being created a Raja Bahadur, was granted a salute of 9 guns as a personal distinction which was made permanent in 1878. This was a rare distinction in those days and made the position of Kalahandi quite unique among the groups of States in the Central Provinces and Orissa. Until very recently, too, the Ruler of no other State in this Agency enjoyed this high honour. In 1911 the present Ruler, while a minor, was accorded, as a ""Salute"" Chief, the high privilege of being permitted to do homage to Their Imperial Majesties King-Emperor George V and Queen-Empress Mary at their Coronation Darbar held at Delhi and of having the honour of Their Majesties' audience instead of being presented in a group as the other Chiefs of Orissa were. During the Great War the Maharaja served the Empire with exemplary devotion and loyalty. On the outbreak of the War he placed the entire resources of the State at the disposal of the British Crown. Besides contributing Rs. 78,883 to the Orissa Chiefs' Aeroplane Fund, to the general expenses of the War and the various funds for the relief of those who had suffered in it, he rendered further valuable assistance to the British Government in the shape of an efficient labour corps raised in his State. He also invested Rs. 3,75,487 in the Indian War Loans. For his splendid War services he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918. 130 The Maharaja is a kind and considerate Ruler with progressive ideas and is very popular with his subjects. The moral and material welfare of his subjects is always his first consideration. In recognition of his enlightened administration and his sustained efforts to foster the interests of the people, the British Government conferred on the Ruler the title of ""Maharaja"" as a personal and, later on, as an hereditary distinction. The Ruling Chief runs the administration of the State on sound and efficient lines with the assistance of his Dewan. He takes keen and personal interest in all matters and measures conducive to the welfare of his people and the improvement of his State. There are various departments and each is in charge of an able and experienced officer responsible to the Dewan. Education occupies the first and foremost place in State Administration. Primary Education is compulsory in the State. There are 78 educational institutions in the State and all of these maintain a high standard of proficiency. Successful students are sent abroad for collegiate and post-graduate studies. Some students are now prosecuting further studies in British India with the help of scholarships granted by the State. The education of girls receives also the equal attention of the State and Girls' Schools are maintained at the Headquarters as well as in the interior where a fairly large number of girls receive education. The State is liberal in granting medical relief to the people. There are as many as ten well-equipped dispensaries in the State both at the Headquarters and in the interior and each of them is under the charge of a qualified doctor having knowledge of up-to-date methods of treatment. Judged by the figures of attendance, these doctors are doing useful work. Vaccination is free and compulsory in the State. Veterinary surgeons go round the villages and treat cases on the spot. The capital of the State is being served by an efficient Municipality and in the interior adequate sanitary arrangements have been made for the preservation of health. The capital is also fitted with electric lights and there is free supply of pipe water. The Court of the Ruling Chief exercises the powers of the High Court and the Sessions cases are tried by a Sessions Judge. There are Civil and Criminal Courts at the Headquarters and in the muffasils and they administer justice independently without any interference. The State is rich in the potential wealth of minerals and a beginning has been made to work these. Agriculture, however, forms the principal occupation of the people and the State grants munificent sums for land improvement and the construction of irrigation tanks. But the most conspicuous act to the credit of the State for the betterment of the condition of the peasantry is the abolition of the ancient custom of bethi and begar and the pernicious system of bond labour. The honour for this important reform belongs to the present Ruler. The people now find ample time and opportunity to utilize their services for the improvement of their own lands and accept the same with whomsoever they prefer. The sincere loyalty of the State and its Ruler to the British Crown, SO remarkably demonstrated on the critical occasion of the Great War, was also strikingly illustrated in the manner the happy and auspicious occasion of the Royal Silver Jubilee in May, 1935, was celebrated in the State. Under the enthusiastic guidance of the Ruler and the State officials the whole State was en fÃªte with a varied programme of rejoicings in addition to the customary booming of guns, police parade, sports, feeding of the poor, distribution of sweets to school children, fireworks, illuminations, &c. To commemorate that happy occasion a separate Maternity Ward is being added to the existing Hospital at the Headquarters. The death of King-Emperor George V on the 21st January, 1935, was deeply mourned all over the State. 131",SALUTE

With the exception of hilly parts, the State consists of open The central and portion of the State abounds in rich valleys which, to a large extent, still remain under plains well watered during the rainy season by innumerable hill streams. Highlands not fit for cultivation contain forests honeycombed with villages. The reserve and protected forest area is over 2,000 square miles and is almost equal to the cultivated area, and although during the last sixty years the population has gone up over 340 per cent. the State is capable of accommodating a large population. The State is rich in mineral resources and supplies the bulk of the iron ore required by the Tata Iron and Steel Works at Jamshedpur. The ruling family is the leading branch of the ancient Bhanja Dynasty. The other branches of the same dynasty are the ruling families of Keonjhar, Baud and Daspalla. The Zamindari of Kanika, an important Zamindari in the District of Cuttack lying on the sea-shore, is also held by a branch of the same family. The now extinct Gumusar State in Ganjam, bordering on Baud and Daspalla, was also ruled by a line of the Bhanja Rajas. According to an official Gazetteer, all these ""Raj families belong to the same stock claiming descent from Solar race and are held to be high caste Kshatriyas."" In the same volume the origin of the ruling families of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar (according to one tradition) is traced to one Jai Singh, a Kachua Rajput from Jaipur in Rajputana,2 who is said to have come centuries before the foundation of the City of Jaipur in the reign of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II (A. 1693-1743). Again, in a paper by James Prinsep published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. VI, 1837, (pp. 665-671), Lieutenant Kittoe adds in the note, ""The Bhanja Rajas are branches of the Mayurbhanj family who again claim descent from the royal house of Chittor."" But the Bhanja Dynasty is much older than the Kachhawah Dynasty of Amber and Jaipur, and is as old as, if not older than, the Sesodia Dynasty of Mewar (Udaipur). A series of copper-plate grants and traditions of undoubted authenticity have enabled the scholars to reconstruct the early history of the Bhanja Dynasty which definitely supersedes the traditional accounts as recorded in the Gazetteer and some other publications. The earliest known sovereign of this dynasty was Netta Bhanja I, who is assigned to the 8th century A. D. superscript(3) The Mayurbhanj branch of the dynasty would appear from all authentic evidence to have been founded by Kottabhanja, described in the copper-plate land grants as 'a fire to the forests of (his) foes'. His successor was Digabhanja who lived at Khijjingakotta', fort of Khijjinga, modern Khiching.4 The monumental remains of Khiching, dating from the eleventh and twelvth centuries A. D., indicate a high degree of culture and prosperity. According to tradition, later on, the succession passed to the younger branch of the family, and the Ruling Prince married a daughter of the Gajapati, King of Orissa, and received as dowry a district to the east of the Simlipal hill range. This necessitated the transfer of the capital from Khiching to Hariharpur or Haripur, about 11 miles to the south of the present capital, Baripada. The representatives of the disinheritated older branch or Bara Kunwar (Kumar), or elder Prince, live at Raruan near Khiching. The Maharajas of Mayurbhanj occupied a semi-independent position under the Mughal Emperors. In the confusion that followed the illness of the Emperor Shahjahan, the ""Imperial authority had dis, appeared from the Province"". ""Krishna Bhanja of Hariharpur, the leading Zamindar of the Province, during the interregnum spread his power over the country from Medinipur to Bhadrakh"" ""He kept one thousand horse and ten or twelve thousand foot soldiers, and was obeyed and helped by all the Zamindars of his country"" Emperor Aurangzeb appointed Khan-i-Dauran as Governor of Orissa in 1660. When the new Governor reached Jaleswar in the latter half of October, 1660, Krishna Bhanja is said to have rushed towards him with his dagger drawn and was put to death. A different version of this incident is given in contemporary records of the Dutch factories in India, published in Batavia Dagh Register for 1661, the English translation of which is given below :- ""The great Raja Krishna 'Bens,' with two or three other important Chiefs and several thousands of attendants, came to wait upon the new Governor, Khan Dauran, in order to do homage to him as the Emperor's representative, whereupon they were suddenly attacked with the connivance, it was thought, of the Governor and a frightful slaughter ensued. The result was rebellion."" Krishna Bhanja's son Tribikrama Bhanj I, however, submitted to Khan-i-Dauran and received friendly treatment. In 1740, Aliverdi Khan usurped the Masnad of the Subadar of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, after overthrowing Nawab Sarfaraj Khan, and in the following year marched upon Orissa. He was opposed by the Raja of Mayurbhanj. Later on Aliverdi Khan invaded Mayurbhanj. But on the approach of the Mahrattas, Aliverdi Khan retired from Mayurbhanj before he could subdue the State. Nawab Aliverdi Khan, Subadar of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, ceded Orissa, without Chakla Midnapore, to the Bhonsla Raja of Nagpur in 1751. The British obtained possession of Midnapore in 1760 by a treaty concluded with Nawab Mir Qasim of Bengal.

Walter Clavell would ""Tillbichrumbunge"" in the ""Account of Trade of Ballasore,"" written by Walter Clavell in 1676, 8 called writes:-"" And the Raja of Tillbichrumbunge-his country lying near the place (Balasore), the greatest quantity of Tester (Tassar) or Herba is procurable, a settlement was thought the more convenient, because Ginghams, Herba Taffatyes, Herba Lungees (Lungi, loin cloth) and other sorts of Herba goods might be made near and brought hither, and nowhere SO good Herba goods procurable."" The Tassar textiles of Mayurbhanj are famous for their excellence and durability even now. Maharaja Tribikram Bhanja I ruled Mayurbhanj from 1660 to 1688 A. D. From the above account it is clear that no State in Eastern India possesses such a long history of continuous good relations with the British authorities. A letter from the East India Company's Agents at Balasore on the 22nd November, 1763, informed the Governor at Calcutta that the Raja of Mayurbhanj was then at war with the Marathas, and that an army under the Maratha General, Bhaskar Pandit, was marching on Mayurbhanj. In 1764, Bhavani Pandit was sent from Nagpur to Orissa with 5,000 Maratha horse to realise the Chauth (one- fourth of the revenue) of Bengal. In a letter to the Governor received on the 24th November, 1764, Bhavani Pandit wrote that he would shortly march to root out the rebellious Zamindars of Hariharpur, etc."" 10 In another letter received by the Governor on the 2nd December, 1764, Bhavani Pandit informed the Governor that 'he must have heard how at the aforesaid time the Zamindars of Mayurbhanj and Nilgiri plundered the inhabitants of some of the districts of Balasore."" A letter of the 28th February, 1765, indicates that Bhavani Pandit actually invaded Mayurbhanj, but ""retreated to Cuttack"" before that date. 12 Under the direction of Lord Clive, the Governor of Bengal, T. Motte undertook a journey to Sambalpur through Orissa in the year 1766. The following extract from this narrative clearly indicates the relations of the Ruler of Mayurbhanj with the Maratha Government There is usually, at Balasore, a party of thirty horse and five hundred foot, but at this time they were with Pelliji (Pillaji), collecting the tribute of the Muhur Bunge country. The Muhur Bunge country extends from the Neelgur (Nilgiri) hills to the sea, but having borne with impatience a foreign yoke, each expression of such impatience has been punished by dismembering part of the country, for every officer who behaved remarkably well in the expeditions against the rebellious princes was rewarded by a portion of their land under the name of a tallok. On the 24th December, 1767, the Governor of Bengal addressed the following letter to Damodar Bhanja, the then Ruler of Mayurbhanj: Mr. Portsmouth has been appointed to survey the English districts contiguous to sea-shore and furnished with a Perwanah for his protection from the writer. Requests the addressee to give the said gentleman all necessary assistance and to prevent all casual interruption in his business. If he does so, it will strengthen the friendship existing between the addressee and the writer, and the latter will be ready to do everything in his power for the addressee."" Rennell's Bengal Atlas Map No. VII, published according to Act of Parliament by J. Rennell, October 4, 1779"", shows that not only the ""English districts"" were surveyed by the Surveyor-General in Bengal, but also a great portion of the territory of Mayurbhanj (spelt ""MOHURBUNGE"" in the map). There is no doubt that the map was prepared with the active co-operation of the Ruler of Mayurbhanj. Mayurbhanj was at this time a powerful buffer State between the British and the Maratha territories, and occupied a particularly strategic position, as the following observation by Vansittart in his letter to the Governor would testify his country (Mayurbhanj) is SO advantageously situated that with a very little assistance from us he would at any time be able to prevent the Marathas from entering into Bengal from the southward.' Having full knowledge of the situation, Vansittart had the foresight to enquire of the Governor on the 28th February, 1769, as follows:- 'Would you choose that I should enter into a negotiation with the Mohurbunge Raja and engage our protection for his support? Damodar Bhanja died in April, 1796. His senior Rani, Sumitra Devi Bhanja, assumed power during the minority of his adopted son, Trivikrama Bhanja, then known as the Tikait. The road along which the pilgrims from Northern India then travelled passed through Mayurbhanj and the Ruler of the State derived considerable revenue from a tax levied on the pilgrims. After the conquest of Orissa, the British Government desired to have the pilgrim tax abolished and Rani Sumitra Devi Bhanja claimed compensation for the loss of this revenue. The tribute of Mayurbhanj could not, therefore, be fixed in her lifetime. She and Trivikrama Bhanja actively helped the British Government during the Maratha War in 1803, and the services rendered by the Rani on that occasion received official appreciation.

He relinquished all claim to apprehending surrendering to the British authorities a notorious outlaw who had taken refuge in his conferred on and a Khillat consisting of an elephant, a horse, a pair of shawls and dress in 1817 for dominion. Trivikrama Bhanja died in May, 1829, and was succeeded by his son, Jadunath Bhanja. In a Agent, S. Frontier Both by word of mouth and written communications I have used all my letter dated W. Balasore, the 28th April, 1834, Mr. H. Ricketts. Magistrate, writes to the Governor-General's endeavours to make the Raja (Jadunath Bhanja) understand the line of conduct that would be most conducive to his interest as the most worthy son and successor of Rajah Trivikrama Bhanja whose sincere attachment Province to the British Government and uniform good conduct won the respect of the highest authorities in the and was more than once honourably noticed by the Government"". 16 On the 1st June, 1829, Jadunath Bhanja concluded a treaty engagement with the Government. He made at his own expense the portion of the post road to Bombay passing through his territory and was awarded a Khillat in 1832 on that account. Another Khillat was awarded to him in 1841 for seizing and delivering up to the authorities at Midnapore a body of outlaws who had taken refuge in his territory and were charged with having committed a serious dacoity in the British territory. In 1834, Jadunath Bhanja expelled by force the rebellious fief-holder of Bamanghati and thereby saved the State from dismemberment. Four of the pirs or parganas of Bamanghati occupied by the Kols are now administered as part of the British District of Singhbhum. The loyalty of Jadunath Bhanja was put to a severe test when his son-in-law, Arjun Singh, Raja of Singhbhum, revolted in sympathy with the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. The services rendered by the Raja of Mayurbhanj in suppressing the rebellion in Singbhum is thus described by Captain E. T. Dalton, Commissioner of Chota Nagpur, in his letter dated the 23rd February, 1859, addressed to the Secretary to the Government of Bengal There was no appearance of the Mohurbhanj Pikes till December, but the Raja in person with a large following joined me in camp at Chukerdhurpore on the 12th ultimo. I found him very willing to do all that was required of him and never saw reason to doubt his loyalty. He expressed his willingness to remain with me till the disturbances in Singbhum were effectually suppressed, and he furnished at my requisition a body of armed men to hold the post of Assuntulea, and supply escorts for dawk, supplies, etc. Subsequently, when Arjun Singh was driven from his fastness by Lieutenant Birch, his force dispersed and no alternative left to him but to surrender or be ignominiously captured, I placed the Mohurbhanj Raja in a position where his fugitive son-in-law could easily join him when pressed, and this had the desired effect, as reported in my letter No. 39 of the 21st instant"". The Raja of Singhbhum, Arjun Singh, had tried to persuade his father-in-law to join him in the revolt, but Jadunath Bhanja declined to listen to him and warned him of the consequences of his action. In a letter written by the Senior Assistant Commissioner of Singhbhum to the Superintendent of the Tributary Mehals, Cuttack, dated Chyebessa, 1st January, 1858, it is stated After the occupation of Porahat and the escape of the ex-Raja, a quantity of private papers were found in his residence; amongst them are letters to his address from his father-in-law, the Rajah of Mohurbhanj, which bear the appearance of refusals to join him in plans of treason or rebellion. I am happy to state that these letters are highly creditable to the Rajah of Mohurbhanj and they bear ample testimony to his loyal disposition; they are full of excellent advice to the unhappy young man who has so lightly disregarded them, and throughout point to him inutility of rebellion against the British Government."" As a reward for these services the Government of India conferred on Jadunath Bhanja the title of Maharaja Bahadur and a Khillat in 1860. Maharaja Jadunath Bhanja Bahadur died in 1863, and was succeeded by his son, Srinath Bhanja. Maharaja Srinath Bhanja Deo died on the 10th November, 1867, and was succeeded by his nephew, Maharaja Krishna Chandra Bhanja Deo. He loyally supported the Government during the Bhuyan Rebellion of Keonjhar in 1867 and 1868 caused by the rejection of the claim of his own younger brother, Vrundaban Chandra Bhanj, to the gadi of Keonjhar. In the Administration Report of Bengal for 1867-68 and 1868-69 it is stated as follows The Rajah of Mayurbhanj loyally assisted in the settlement of Keonjhar without showing any inclination to support his brother's pretensions. The Mayurbhanj Rajah, in addition to the supply of men, had been doing good service and giving proofs of his loyalty by arresting and making over to the Superintendent messengers sent to him by the Bhooinas with overtures."" Maharaja Krishna Chandra Bhanja Deo was an able and enlightened Ruler, and was created a Maharaja in 1877 in recognition of his efficient administration of the State and his public liberality. After his death in May, 1882, the State came under Government management owing to the minority of his son, Sri Ram Chandra Bhanja Deo, who was placed in charge of the State in 1890, He received a liberal education and in 1910 made a trip to England via Japan and America and was honoured by an audience granted by His Majesty King-Emperor George V. His State was administered on British Judicial (Criminal) Proceedings, 5th May, 1834, No. 15. Records of the Political Agent's Office Record-room, Sambalpur. 18 Ibid. 137 lines under his personal supervision and in a manner which earned the commendation of successive Political Officers. In 1903 the title of Maharaja was conferred on him as a personal distinction. This title was made hereditary in June, 1910. Maharaja Sri Ram Chandra Bhanja Deo was a guest of the Government at the Imperial Delhi Durbar of 1903, and also attended the Imperial Durbar at Delhi in 1911. The programme of Their Imperial Majesties' visit to Calcutta in 1912 included a War Dance by the Paiks of Mayurbhanj, the organisation and management of which was undertaken by the Maharaja. It was the most interesting and lively item in the whole show. ""The Oriya Paik dance was a great spectacle,"" observed the Statesman in its issue of 6th January, 1912, and on the same day the Englishman described it as follows:- The War Dance of the Oriya Paiks, it is understood, was much admired by Their Majesties. The Paiks danced their best, and furnished a relief from the monotony of the silent processions."" The heir-apparent, Tikait Purnachandra Bhanja Deo, was a page of honour to Her Majesty the Empress on this occasion. Later on Their Imperial Majesties expressed their appreciation of the Paik Dance, and the late King-Emperor George V himself made a special reference to this in his letter of the 24th February, 1912, to the then Viceroy of India, in which, after graciously conveying his sincere condolence on the Maharaja's accidental death, His Majesty observed as follows We remember, of course, the important part taken by the Maharaja in connection with the pageant on the maidan and our pleasure in seeing him on that occasion."" After his death on the 22nd February, 1912, his elder son, Maharaja Purna Chandra Bhanja Deo, succeeded him while yet a minor, and was officially installed on the gaddi in 1920. He offered his personal services during the Great War and proceeded to France on active service, but before he reached France the Armistice was signed. From France he proceeded to England where he was granted an audience by the late King-Emperor, in 1919. Besides this personal service of the Ruler, the State adequately helped the Government with money and men. For his War services the Maharaja was granted a permanent salute of 9 guns and was made an Honorary Lieutenant. He was also chosen as an A.D.C. to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales during his visit to Patna. His Excellency the Governor of Bihar and Orissa visited the State in 1923 and spoke appreciatively of the State in the following terms :- 'Among this (Orissa) group, Mayurbhanj takes the lead in area and very easily in population and revenue, and in modern times its progress has been continuous. Its ruling family has the advantage of a long and distinguished historical tradition and from the days of Maharaja Krishna Chandra Bhanja Deo in 1868, followed in 1882 by your late lamented father, Maharaja Sri Ram Chandra Bhanja Deo, modern ideals of administration have been steadily pursued with conspicuous success. The record of the State during the War was an honourable one : it subscribed generously to many funds which then made appeals and seldom unsuccessfully. Since the War your liberal donation of a lakh of rupees to the Revenshaw College, Cuttack, was particularly acceptable."" Maharaja Purna Chandra Bhanja Deo died on the 21st April, 1928, without any issue, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Maharaja Pratap Chandra Bhanja Deo. The restrictions imposed by the Sanad on the powers of the Maharaja were abrogated by the Government in March, 1931, and the Maharaja exercises full powers of internal administration and has been a member of the Chamber of Princes in his own right since March, 1931. His Excellency the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, in his letter dated 9th March, 1931, addressed to the Chancellor of the Chamber of Princes, while admitting the Maharaja as a permanent member, made the following observations:- ""I have not referred the case of Mayurbhanj to the Standing Committee, since the difficulty in regard to it has been restrictions imposed by Government on the powers of the State, and not its size and importance. It is by far the largest among the Bihar and Orissa States which have as yet no permanent member in the Chamber. With an area over 4,000 square miles and revenue of some Rs. 30 lakhs, it is obviously fit to stand among the larger Indian States, and I have satisfied myself that its administration is efficient, enlightened and progressive. I have, therefore, with the concurrence of the Bihar and Orissa Government cancelled the specific restrictions in the Mayurbhanj Sanad, which would prevent its being considered a State with full internal jurisdiction, and have decided to summon the Maharaja for the forthcoming Chamber Session as a full Member. In so doing I am impressed by the changed conditions arising out of the Round Table Conference, since the issues to be discussed at the next meeting of the Chamber are of momentous importance to all States, and I feel strongly that the time is opportune to remedy the anomalous position of the large and important State of Mayurbhanj."" Maharaja Pratap Chandra Bhanja Deo was created a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire in January, 1935, He donated a lakh of rupees to the Silver Jubilee Fund of His late Majesty. The Royal Silver Jubilee was celebrated in the State in a befitting manner and the festivities were attended by thousands of people. The death of King-Emperor George V evoked feelings of genuine grief all over the State and mourning was observed in all sincerity by the State and its subjects.

The Ruling family are Gohel Rajputs and descended from the same stock as the Ruling Houses of Bhavnagar and Lathi. The State pays no revenue are to the British Government but pays certain amounts to the Baroda and Junagadh States as Peshkashi and Jortalbi respectively. The State receives from the Baroda State Rs. 300 on account of the village of Rupavati, which was originally given as Giras (Patrimony) by the Palitana State to one of its Bhayats, whose descendants are still in its occupation. The reversionary rights of the land in this village belong to the Palitana Durbar. It enjoys full internal jurisdiction. The Ruler is entitled to a permanent dynastic salute of 9 guns. The original home of the Gohels, who trace their ancestry to the Solar race of the deified King Ramchandra, was at Khergadh on the Luni river in Marwar. In about 1250 A.D. their Chief, Sejakji, migrated to Saurashtra where he received from the Rawat of Junagadh a grant of Shahpur and twelve other villages. Sejakji had three sons-Ranoji, Shahji and Sarangji. Shahji was the founder of the State of Palitana. He had received the Chovisi of Mandvi but established an independent principality at Gariadhar on the occupation of Mandvi by Mohammadans. Prathiviraj (1697-1734 A.D.), tenth in descent from Shahji, shifted from Gariadhar to Palitana and made it his chief seat of Government. Unadji, eighteenth in descent from Shahji, had a great military renown. He consoli- dated his dominions, collected a well-dis- ciplined army and more than once attempted to take possession of the Bhavnagar Capital, at that time situated at Sihor. But Wakhat- sinhji, the then Ruler of Bhavnagar, proved Thakore Saheb Shri Sir Bahadursinhji, K.C.I.E., Palitana State. too strong for him and retaliated by ravaging the territory of Gariadhar. The two Houses were, however, reconciled through the mediation of Kumbhoji of Gondal. All this unrest and commotion led to financial embarrassment from which Unadji was helped out by Wakhatchand Khushalchand, the Nagar-Sheth of Ahmedabad, who lent him large sums of money in consideration of the State revenues being farmed to him for ten years. Unadji's grandson, Pratapsinhji, redeemed the State from its mortgaged position. The administration was also reorganised by him and a beautiful Palace was built. Pratapsinhji died after only eight months' reign and was succeeded by his son, Sursinhji, born in 1844 A.D. Sursinhji introduced several reforms on the lines of British administrative methods and freed the State completely from debt and many other complications. Sursinhji died in 1885 and was succeeded by Mansinhji, who was born on June 7, 1862. Thakore Sahib Shri Mansinhji was made a K.C.S.I. in 1896. He took great interest in horse- breeding and his paddock produced fine specimens of pure Kathis and stud-bred stock. Thakore Sahib Shri Sir Mansinhji died on the 29th August, 1905, and was succeeded by his son, Bahadursinhji, the present Ruler. Thakore Sahib Shri Sir Bahadursinhji, K.C.I.E., was born in 1900 and educated at Rajkumar College, Rajkot, and Shrewsbury King Edward Public School, London.

It came under the British protection in 1803 and ever since it has been well known for its unswerving loyalty and devoted service to the British Crown.

99,Sonepur,"THE STATE of OF SONEPUR is a principal State in the Eastern States Agency and its Capital, the and town is Sonepur, contains, of all the former Orissa States of the Agency, the largest population, picturesquely situated at the confluence of the Mahanadi and the Tel. The Ruler enjoys a permanent salute of 9 guns. On the evidence of inscriptions and from the study of old temples it has been conclusively proved that the town of Sonepur (then written as Suvarnapur) was once the Capital of the Trikalinga country of South Kosala ruled by the Trikalinga Guptas during the 10th century A.D. Another name for Sonepur was then Yayatinagara. Poet Dhyoyi of Bengal speaks of this town in his Pavanaduta' as a flourishing one worth visiting. After the Trikalinga Guptas, Chohan Rulers of the present Ruling House became the rulers of this State. The present Ruler traces his pedigree from the illustrious Prithviraj, the last great Hindu Emperor of Delhi and Ajmere, whose descendants established in the 12th century a powerful kingdom in this part of the country consisting of the States of Patna and Sambalpur and were regarded as overlords by many neighbouring States including Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar.

The founder of this State was Sri Madangopal Singh Deo. This State always enjoyed complete independence and never came under the Maratha Rule. When the Marathas ceded their territories to the British Crown, the latter came into political relations with this State as well as with other neighbouring States.

In recognition of his invaluable services during the Great War the honour of K.C.I.E. was conferred on him by the Government.

The proper history of the State begins from the early part of the eighteenth century with the gift of the Akalkot Pargana to Fattehsinh Bhonsle, the ancestor of the Rajas of Akalkot, as a logical culmination of a series of heroic and romantic episodes with Raja Shahu's historic struggle for his heritage after his liberation from captivity. His march to the Deccan to get back his kingdom, supported by several Maratha officers and leaders, met with a strong opposition from Tarabai, who declared him to be an imposter. On his way Shahu went from Ahmednagar to Parad. The headman, a Maratha named Lokhande, held the village in Moghul interest. He closed the gates, fired on Shahu's outposts and shot dead the royal messenger who called on him, as a loyal subject, to admit him into the town. Shahu decided to make an example of the truculent peasant. He sent for his artillery and batter- ed a breach in the walls. As he was about to order the assault, the headman's daughter- in-law rushed out of the village and put her baby at the King's feet and begged him to spare it. The King greeted the young woman kindly and, after having her taken to a place of safety, ordered the attack. The troops poured through the breach and put to the sword Lokhande and most of the villagers. Gratified with this success, the King, on his return to camp, adopted the Lokhande baby as his own, gave him the surname of Bhonsle and called him Fattehsinh or the Lion of Victory. He gave him also the fief of Akalkot. Silver Jubilee Festivities. A series of successes, which Shahu attributed to the baby, drove Tarabai to Kolhapur, and Shahu was crowned at Satara in 1708. Fattehsinh grew such a favourite of the Raja that he had a separate suite of apartments built for him in the Palace at Satara. In 1710 Fattehsinh received the Jagir of Akalkot and the title of Raja a title which has been recognised by the British Government, but without the prefix of His Highness.

There are good metalled roads connecting the adjacent States and touching all important villages in the interior. The State was founded in 1554 A. D. by Uddhab Dev, a Kshattriya Prince, a descendant of Kapilendra Dev of the Ganga Dynasty, the famous sovereign of the defunct Orissa Kingdom. The present Ruler, Raja Bahadur Naba Kishore Chandra Singh Mardraj Jagdeb, M. R. A. S., F. R. S. A. (London), is twenty-second in descent from Uddhab Dev. He was born in 1891, succeeded his father in 1906 at the age of fifteen and was invested with ruling powers on the 20th October, 1913. He was educated at first in Ravenshaw Collegiate School, Cuttack, and finally passed the Diploma Examination of the Rajkumar College at Raipur, C.P. His first marriage took place in 1913 with the eldest daughter of the Raja Sahib of Khariar in C. P., a descendant of the Chouhan origin. On the demise of his first Rani, the Ruler married again the only daughter of the Raja Sahib of Thuamul Rampur of the well-known Nag family. During the Great European War the Ruler of Hindol raised a handsome War loan and regularly contributed to the other funds in connection with the War. If there is one trait in the character of the Chief which seems to outshine all others, it is his whole-hearted loyalty and devotion to the Crown. The Chief was awarded for his loyalty the Coronation Medal in 1911 and the title of Raja Bahadur as a personal distinction in 1921. He was also once elected as a representative to the Chamber of Princes from the Orissa States. The Ruler is much interested in Astrology, Ayurved, Homoeopathy and Engineering. He takes keen interest in P. W. D. and spends about a quarter of the land revenue for the maintenance of the roads and buildings and for the purpose of irrigation as well. The Capital of the State is provided with Raja Bahadur Naba Kishore Chandra Singh Mardraj Jagdeb, M.R.A.S., F.R.S.A. (London), Hindol State, (E.S.A.) electric light. The State is also served by a tele- phone system which connects the nearest Railway station, official quarters and all institutions in Sudder and Muffasil. The Raja Bahadur is very simple in dress and frugal in habits, quite in keeping with the principle of plain living and high thinking. His many estimable qualities of head and heart have endeared him to all classes of his subjects. He has introduced many reforms in the State on modern lines and has established educational, industrial and charitable institutions of various types.

During the comparative peace that followed he brought his State to a position of prosperity and made full use of his marked administrative abilities. His adopted son, Ramchandrarao, better known as Appasahib, enjoyed a peaceful and prosperous rule of over half a century. He brought the whole administrative machinery to a high state of efficiency on modern and up-to-date lines and undertook the mighty task of imparting free primary and secondary education to his subjects. Jamkhandi owes much to Appasahib for his ability to keep pace with other premier States in the Deccan. His successor, Parashuramrao Bhausahib, the father of the present Ruler, was installed on the gaddi in June 1903. He revealed great administrative abilities and within a decade of his assuming control of his State had them recognised by the conferment on him of the K.C.I.E. by His Majesty the King-Emperor. He proved to be a worthy descendant of his namesake, the great Parashuram Bhau, by his prompt and spontaneous offer of his personal services to the British Empire in the World War. He was on active service with an Ambulance Corps on the Western Front and also served on the Red Cross Commission in Mes- opotamia. He received the King's Commis- sion in 1918 and the honour of a personal salute of 9 guns. He had the honour of being an Honorary A. D. C. to three successive Governors of Bombay. The present Ruler, Shrimant Raja Shankarrao Appasahib, the Rajasahib, was invested with full powers in May, 1926.

124,Jath,"THE JATH STATE is one of the best known States in the Deccan under political relations with the Agent the to British the Governor-General at Kolhapur. It is bounded by the State of Sangli to the west, by District of Belgaum to the south, Sholapur to the north and Bijapur to the east. It is 9,808 square miles in area with a population of 91,099 souls and gross revenue of Rs. 353,494 a year. There are six miles of Railway and forty miles of metalled road in the State. There are flourishing occupations agriculturists. The State pays to the British Government Rs. 11,247 in all by way of cottage industries of the like leather work, hand-spinning and weaving, carpentry, poultry, etc., as subsidiary tribute. The Durbar also maintains a very efficient Police Force which is divided into two branches, viz., the D. Force and the other the armed Force consisting of two Platoons known as the Jath Guards. The latter is commanded by able military men. The State entered into treaty relations with the British Government in 1820. Ancient History. The Jath State was founded by Satwajirao, the son of Lakhamojirao Yaldojirao Chavan, Patil of Daflapur, a village in the Jath State. His bravery attracted the notice of Alli Adilshaha, the King of Bijapur, who took him in his service in 1672 and conferred upon him in perpetuity the Deshmukhi Watan of the four Mahals, viz. Jath, Karajagi, Bardol and Vanwad, on payment of a Nazar of 3,000 Mohars. Satwajirao continued to be one of the leading noblemen of the Bijapur Court until its final over- throw by the Emperor Aurangzeb in 1686. After the downfall of the Bijapur kingdom Satwajirao assumed complete independence and began to exercise his own authority over a large portion of the kingdom. Emperor Aurangzeb ordered his General to capture Satwajirao and to convey him to the Royal Court. Failing to secure Satwajirao the Moghul General captured his brother Dhondjirao and took him to the Emperor. Out of affection for his brother Satwajirao surrendered himself to Aurangzeb promising to serve him faithfully. The Emperor took his son, Bavajirao, in his army and raised him to a very high position. In 1700, during the siege of the fortress of Ajimatara in the District of Satara, Bavajirao was the first to leap into a breach in the wall and plant the Moghul Emperor's flag on the bastion which is still known as the ""Dafle's Bastion"". He died of many serious wounds received in the battle. Pleased with Bavajirao's gallantry, the Emperor bestowed on Satwajirao in 1704 the Jagir of Jath and Karajagi Mahals along with command of 5,000 horses. Satwajirao then made the town of Jath his Capital. He thus rose from the ordinary rank of a Patil to that of a ruling Chief. But he did not survive long. The death of his second son, Khanajirao, had a great effect on him and he passed away in 1706. On his death his widowed daughter-in-law, Yesubai alias Ausahib, succeeded him. She was very pious and ably managed the State. A succession of Rulers occupied the gaddi with varying success until the ninteenth century when we find the State from 1810 to 1822 in the hands of Renukabai, widow of Khanajirao, a worthy descendant of the House founded by Satwajirao. It was during her efficient rule, that is, in 1820, that the State entered into Treaty relations with the British Government. Towards the middle of the nineteenth century, in the absence of any direct descendant of the House, the gaddi passed to Bhimrao, adopted from the Dafle Bhauband of Umarani. The Dafles represented a branch of the Rajmandal Jagirdars, enjoying the distinction of the Royal Insignia of Morchal, in the time of the Moghuls. Bhimrao ascended the gaddi in 1846 by the name of Amritrao alias Rao Sahib. On the death of Amritrao in 1892 issueless, the gaddi was conferred on Buvajirao, the fourth son as Parasharamrao Dafle of Umarani and father of the present Ruler. After completion of his education in Rajkumar College, Raikot, and a proper course of administrative training, Buvajirao was installed on the gaddi on the 11th July, 1907, by the name of Shrimant Ramrao Amritrao alias Abasahib Dafle. He was married to Shrimant Putala Raje, second daughter of the late Raja Sahib of Akalkot. She was in every respect a worthy consort of her noble husband. As Head of the Jath State for 21 years Shrimant Ramrao proved a most progressive and sym- pathetic Ruler, zealous and untiring in his efforts to advance the moral and material well-being of his subjects. He made education free and compulsory throughout the State and established a High School in Jath. To improve the conditions of the agriculturists he started institutions like Jath People's Bank and Famine Relief Fund. He improved the architectural appearance of Jath by erecting several imposing buildings. He offered many facilities to the Barsi Light Railway introduced in the State to develop the trade of the town and the State. He also introduced the Boy Scout movement in the State in 1923, which through the active participation of his three worthy sons in the same, grew immensely popular. In his private life Shrimant Ramrao was amiable and courteous and was loved by all who came in contact with him. He died prematurely on the 14th August, 1928, leaving behind three sons and two daughters. His untimely passing away was deeply mourned by his loving subjects. Present History. The present Ruler, Shrimant Vijaysinhrao alias Babasahib Dafle, was declared by the Government as heir to the gaddi on the 30th September, 1928, and was installed with due ceremony on the 12th January, 1929. 169 He was born on the 21st July, 1909. He passed the Matriculation examination with distinction in 1928. He was studying in the Deccan College when he was called back owing to the serious illness of his late lamented father. The late Ruler lost no opportunity in initiating the present Ruler in all the aspects of State administration. Since his accession to the gaddi he has endeavoured to be in closest touch with the working of all departments and he proved, at so young age, a singularly smart and promising Ruler. Like his illustrious father, he is intelligent, industrious and courteous. He is an all-round sports- man and a good cricketer. His sportsman-like qualities and his great kindness to his people have made him immensely popular. Like his father, he personally hears the complaints of his subjects and is approachable to all alike at any time of the day. Within so short a period as six years of his beneficient and progressive rule he has introduced many useful reforms in the State. Thanks to his benevolence, the State is now in the happy possession of a Local Board, a High Court, and one more charitable dispensary for the benefit of distant villages. He has also done much to improve the lot of the agriculturists, his main work in that direction being the creation of the 'Hospet Tank"" for supplying water to neighbouring villages for agricultural purposes all the year round. The Scout movement also has received a great stimulus during his reign. He is the Chief Scout of the Jath State. When India's destiny was on the anvil, the present Ruler was given an opportunity to be present at the third Round Table Conference and he made many attempts to better the position of the Satara and S. M. C. States. He holds the King's Commission in the Royal Indian Navy, having spent four months in the Royal Indian Navy in training, being attached to H.M.I.S. 'Pathan."" He is now a Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Indian Navy. The long contemplated marriage of Shrimant Vijayasinhrao Ramrao was celebrated on the 27th March, 1929, with great pomp and splendour, with Shrimant Lilavatiraje, the eldest daughter of the late Raja Sahib of Akalkot. Thus the two illustrious Houses of Jath and Akalkot were once more united and the old relations were doubly connected. Members of the Ruling Family. The Ruler's younger brother, Shrimant Rajkumar Ajitsinhrao Dafle, is in England to qualify himself for the Bar. He is a fine sportman, a winner of many prizes. His youngest brother, Rajkumar Udayasinhrao Dafle, studying at school, has been an outstanding figure in Cricket Shield Matches at Poona. His elder sister, Shrimant Soubhagyavati Pramila Raje, is married to Shrimant Maharaj Kumar Vikramasinhrao Powar, Yuvraj and President-in-Council, Dewas Senior State. His second younger sister Rajkumari Kamala Raje, yet unmarried, is being educated privately. Shrimant Bhagirathibaisahib, Dowager Ranisahiba of Jath, stays with the Ruler. Shrimant Yeshodabaisaheb alias Akkasahib, daughter of adoptive mother of Shrimant Chhatrapati Bhosale of Satara, a descendant in direct line of Shivaji the Great, is another member of the Ruler's family.

129,Keonjhar,"THE KEONJHAR STATE is the third largest of the Orissa States, having an area 3,217 square miles with a population of 4,60,609 souls and an average annual income of of 15 lakhs of rupees. The tribute paid to Government amounts to Rs. 1,710-1-3. The Capital of the State, Keonjhargarh, is about sixteen hundred feet above sea-level. The Ruling House represents the Kuchhwaha clan of Suryabansi Rajputs and belongs to the same stock as the Ruling House of Jaipur in Rajputana. In 1098 A.D. one Joti Singh, son of Man Singh, a Chief of Jaipur, came on a pilgrimage to Puri, where he married the daughter of the Ruling Chief of Puri and received as dowry the territory of Hariharpur which comprised modern Mayurbhunj and Upper Keonjhar. Of this union two sons were born and were named respectively Adi Singh and Joti Singh. Their father before his death divided his territory of Hariharpur between them. On or about 1128 A.D. the first forts erected by these two brothers were Adipur in Mayurbhunj and Jotipur in Keonjhar, both on the opposite banks of Baitarani. Later the younger brother, Joti Singh, moved to a more central spot, eventually settling at a place called Kendujhar which has been corrupted into Keonjhar. The Keonjhar State gained in fresh accessions by grants from the Emperors of Delhi and the Maharatta Sovereigns. The title of Bhunj (Bhunjan-to break) was given to Adi Singh by the Chief of Puri for subduing an obstinate Chief, Mayurdhwaja. This title has remained in the two families of Mayurbhunj and Keonjhar. Later on a Prince and Heir-apparent of the Ruling family of Keonjhar, Govind Bhunj, falling out with his father, took military service with the Puri Ruler. By his bravery and military genius he gained a decisive victory in a big battle at Kanchi-Kaveri (Kanjeveram, Madras Presidency), and as a reward was awarded by the Puri Ruler, on his succession to the gaddi, the Zamindary of Athgarh, better known as the Anandpur Sub-division, which still forms a very important part of this State. The next additions to the State were the villages of Rachipur and Jujhpada by Raja Pratap Balabhadra Bhunj in 1751 A.D. and recognised by the East India Company as part of the State when making a treaty with Raja Janardan Bhunj. Keonjhar is divided into two widely dissimilar tracts. Lower Keonjhar (Anandpur Sub-division inclusive of Jujhpada) is a region of valleys and lowlands, while Upper Keonjhar (Sadar Sub-division including Bhunya and Juang Pirhs and Champua Sub-division) consists of mountainous highlands, the highest peak, Mankarnacha, being 3,639 feet. The principal river in the State is the Baitarani. The main road, running a distance of 87 miles from north to south of the State, forms part of the road route from Calcutta to Cuttack via Ranchi and is bridged throughout. There are some very beautiful temples in the State. Keonjhar is renowned for its jungles which cover more than half the area of the State and are the home of practically every kind of Indian game found in the plains except wild buffalo. The State is rich in minerals. During the last decade very great quantities of iron and manganese ore have been mined and exported by Messrs. Bird & Co. of Calcutta. The Tata Iron and Steel Company also hold mines leases over large tracts in the State.

Religion plays an important part in the life of the present Ruler who is a very staunch supporter of his faith. He married, on the 15th June, 1929, the eldest daughter of the Ruling Chief of the State of Kharsawan, one of the 26 Orissa States. Raja Sahib is a cultured and progressive Ruler and is very desirous of bettering the lot of his subjects. Since his accession to the gaddi things have been moving forward in the State.

There are well-paid Revenue officers attached to each Sub-division. The Heads of all Departments in the State are working under the immediate control and supervision of an experienced Dewan, to whom, as well as to the Ruler, the subjects have free access. Consistently with its liberal and enlightened administration the State has safeguarded the interests of all aboriginal tenants by the enactment of a law forbidding transfers of their holdings to Aryan cultivators. Routrai Basudev Bhunj Deo, step-uncle of the Raja, gets a monthly allowance of Rs. 450. Chotrai Lakshmi Narayan Bhunj Deo, B.A., younger brother of the Ruling Chief, assists his brother in all his beneficent activities.

About square miles are covered with forest, the principal species being teak, bija, sal and bamboo. The chief industries of the State are brass vessels and wooden furniture, and carpets of a good quality are produced in the jail. The rolling of indigenous cigarettes gives employment to a considerable number of persons. The Bengal-Nagpur Railway passes through the south of the State, with the stations of Bortalao, Dongargarh and Musra within its limits. About 63 miles of embanked and 57 miles of unembanked roads were constructed over thirty years ago, the most important being those from Dongargarh through Khairagarh to Kawardha and from Khairagarh to Raj-Nandgaon. Some 65 miles of new road have been constructed since. The incidence of land revenue is about Rs. 1-1-0 per occupied acre. A regular cadastral survey had been carried out and the method of assessment is that prescribed for British districts. The revenue is settled with the headmen of villages who are allowed a commission of 20 or 30 per cent of the assets but have no proprietory rights. The rents of the cultivators are also fixed at settlement. The State is distinctly progressive in regard also to education, sanitation, medical relief, &c.

161,Seraikella,"SERAIKELLA STATE, in the Eastern States Agency, is 449 square miles in area with a population of 143,525 souls and an average annual revenue of Rs. 4,50,000. The Ruling family are Rathor Rajputs. About 900 years ago a scion of the famous Rathor clan migrated from Kanauj, and established a kingdom, which came to be known, after the name of his clan, as ""Singhbhum,"" or the Land of Singhs, or lions. It is a matter of common historical knowledge how the Kingdom of Gazapati (Puri) and Chauhans (Sambalpur-Patna), under which all the other States of Orissa remained, broke up gradually, and how they came under different powers, such as the Mughals and the Marhattas, until ceded by the latter to the British Government in and subsequent to 1803. Even Maurbhanja, the biggest State in Orissa, had the misfortune of being used as a pawn in the political games of history. Singhbhum, however, never came under the sway of any power, Indian or foreign, till it entered into relationship with the British Government. Long before the advent of the British a brother of the then Ruler of Singhbhum founded the State of Seraikella by conquering territories from the neighbouring States. His descendants similarly enlarged their dominions and the importance of Seraikella gradually increased to such an extent that, in place of the parent family, the Ruler of Seraikella came to be known as the Raja of Singhbhum. Consequently in Singhbhum the British looked to Seraikella for help during the Marhatta Wars of 1803. They further sought the help of Seraikella in 1818, and also, subsequently, for the suppression of turbulent and refractory tribes, and the peaceful establishment of their position in the neighbouring districts, and during also the Sepoy Mutiny. Unfortunately the State of Porahat representing the parent family was confiscated by the British Government for treason during the Sepoy Mutiny, and since then Seraikella remains as head of the family to perpetuate the traditions of the ancient House which established the Singhbhum Kingdom, and claims to be one of the most ancient and original families among the States of Orissa. To quote the Bengal District Gazetteer, ""Singhbhum was never reduced under the dominions of the Mughals, but has for 52 generations been an independent district in the possession of the present family."" 'The jurisdiction of the Marhattas had never extended to Singhbhum, nor did they receive the smallest revenue from it."" Unlike other States of Orissa, or the Central Provinces, Seraikella was never ceded to the British Government. In 1803, during the Marhatta War, the Marquess of Wellesley caused a friendly communication to be addressed to the Ruler of Seraikella, inviting his assistance in the war against the Marhattas, and assuring him that the British Government would always respect his rights and hold Seraikella tribute-free. Lord Minto, the next Governor-General, similarly addressed the Ruler of Seraikella as an equal rather than a dependent Chief, and recognised him as one of the staunchest friends of the British. In 1819 Major Roughsedge, under the instructions of the Supreme Government, wrote to the Ruler of Seraikella as follows is considered necessary to enlist your country also under the protection of this Government. It is intended to preserve and keep intact whatever position, respect, honour, or land you might be holding from before."" Seraikella, which was then fully sovereign and independent, acknowledged, of its own accord, the British Paramountcy, in consideration of the solemn assurance of the British Government to preserve intact the internal autonomy or sovereignty of the State as before, and not to demand any tribute. Although on the 1st of February, 1820, a Patta and a Kabuliyat were exchanged between the British Government and Porahat, and although it was, perhaps, intended to exchange similar documents between the Ruler of Seraikella and the British, no documents were so exchanged. The belief that similar documents were so exchanged has led to a confusion and to an assumption that Seraikella stood upon the same footing as Porahat. The relations between the Ruler of Seraikella and the British Government are regulated by the kharitas of Lord Wellesley in 1803 and those of Lord Minto in 1808, which have been supplemented by Sanads of 1899 and 1919. The State was transferred to the control of the Political Agent, Orissa States, in 1916, and is at present placed in direct relationship with the Government of India through the Agent to the Governor-General, Eastern States Agency. The Rajas of Seraikella have always been distinguished for sincere and steadfast loyalty to the British with Government. During the Kol rebellion of 1837 Raja Ajamber Singh served the British Government exemplary devotion, SO much SO that he died of illness brought on by exposure and fatigue in that campaign. rewarded the British a Khillat and the grant rent-free in perpetuity of the Sub-State of Karaikella.

The Maharajah contributed about Rs. 30,000 to During at the the Great War of 1914-18 the State, in common with sister States of India, placed all 210 different War funds and contributed about a lakh of rupees to the War loan. In addition to these a large number of labourers in the State helped to produce various war materials and some 1600 labourers worked in the Government forest for supply of timber to Mesopotamia. Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh died on the 9th December, 1931, and was succeeded, as his eldest son was dead, by his grandson, the present Ruler. The present Ruler, Raja Aditya Pratap Singh Deo, was born on the 30th July, 1887, and is 61st in descent from the founder of the Singh Dynasty in Singhbhum. He had started his administrative career under the guidance of his illustrious grandfather, and after completing his education received further practical training of administration in British Districts under renowned I. C. S. officers. His keen judicial sense received recognition almost in flattering terms from such Political Agents as Mr. Codden Ramsay and Mr. C. L. Philip. It was left to him on his succession to the Gadi to organise the adminis- tration of the State on modern lines. And he has been doing it with notable success. Since he took over charge of the administration the real revenue has shown a definite improvement by 400 per cent. over the figures of 18 years. Education and Public Works receive his intense and continued interest. The people of the State are fondly devoted to the Ruler for his love towards them and the incessant benefits they continue to receive from him. He is not only their Ruler but a father in every sense of the term. He married the only daughter of the late Maharajah Ram Chandra Singh Deo of the Patna State. A grandson was born to him on the 29th June, 1930. Tikayet Nrupendra Narayan Singh Deo, B.A., B.L., is the Heir-apparent of the State. He was born on the 21st March, 1908. He married the eldest daughter of the Maharajah of Kalahandi. He is the Chief Member (Vice-President) of the State Council and helps the Ruler in all branches of administration. He received First Class Gold Medal from the late Chief in a State Durbar held in 1931 in recognition of his meritorious services to the State and also the Jubilee Medal in 1935. The second son of the Ruler, adopted by the late Maharajah of Patna, is the present Maharajah of Patna. The Royal Silver Jubilee in May, 1935, was celebrated in the State with befitting pomp and splendour. A salute of 31 guns heralded the 6th of May at Seraikella town, the capital of the State, tastefully decorated with flags and festoons. The Brahmins and others offered Pujas and Thanksgiving service before the deities in the various temples and other places of worship for the long life and prosperous reign of Their Majesties. At about 7-30 A.M., a ceremonial Police Parade of the Reserved Armed Force of the State was held in the spacious compound within the Palace. The salute was taken by the Ruler of the State in the presence of the members of the Ruling Family and high officials of the State. Between the hours 8 to 9 A.M., students of the Seraikella Raj H. E. School were entertained with dainty dishes of sweets. The Headmaster in charge and his colleagues spared no pains to make the function a success. By this time the boys and girls, numbering about 400, of the five Ward Primary schools of the Capital were served with light refreshments under the able supervision of the S. I. of Schools and the teachers of the respective schools. Similarly the boys and girls of the rural schools of the State, numbering about 2,500, were entertained with dishes of sweets under the supervision of the Managing Committee and teaching staff of the respective schools. At about 10 to 11 A.M., a large number of poor people and children numbering about 1,000 were sumptuously fed within the H. E. School compound. The Headmaster in charge and the teachers, with the help of a batch of enthusiastic school children, worked hard to make the function a grand success. The poor people were much delighted. In the afternoon an informal Durbar was held by the Ruler of the State, at which the members of the State Council, the Ruling family members, the State officials and the elite of the town were present, and speeches were delivered eulogising the eventful progress of Their Majesties' happy and prosperous reign. In this Durbar the Ruling Chief decorated a number of recipients of the King's Silver Jubilee Medal including himself and the Heir-apparent Tikayet N. N. Singh Deo, B.A., B.L., and Kanwar Sahib B. P. Singh Deo, B.A., F.R.A.S., M.R.S.A., Development Member, and Maharaj Kumar D. R. Singh Deo, Home Member of the State Council. In the evening all public and private buildings in the Capital were illuminated, the most noteworthy illuminations being those of the public buildings and the Palace for which the P.W.D. did all that could be done in this respect. With tasteful decoration with flags and festoons, and with the blaze of electric and other lights, the whole town presented a gala appearance. At about 7-30 P.M., there was a big Nagar Sankirtan party who paraded the main road of the town. A big crowd assembled to witness this impressive ceremony. In the interior Jatra performances, variety dances by the Hos, Sanhtal and other aboriginal tribes were held at different centres in which the people of the surrounding villages joined and enjoyed a merry and pleasant night. The villages in the interior were also decorated with mango and other leaves beautifully and presented a unique appearance. The common topic of the day was Their Majesties and their eventful career of 25 years' prosperous reign. In the noon of the 7th instant the Ruling Chief held a Durbar in the compound of the Victoria Hospital under a Shamiana and formally laid the foundation-stone of the Maternity Home to commemorate this happy occasion of Their Majesties' Silver Jubilee. The entire cost of the celebrations has been met by the State. The death of King-Emperor George V on the 21st January, 1936, was deeply mourned all over the State. 211",NON-SALUTE
162,Sirguja,"THE SIRGUJA STATE, in the Eastern States Agency, is the largest of the transferred Chhota-Nagpur States and lies in the middle of them, bounded on the north by the Mirzapur district of the United Provinces and the State of Rewa, on the east by the Palamau and Ranchi districts of Bengal, on the south by the Jashpur and Udaipur States and the district of Bilaspur and of the west by the Korea State. It is 6,058 square miles in area with a population of 502,058 souls and an average annual revenue of Rs. 7,94,678. The Ruling family belongs to the Raksel clan of Rajputs. The present Chief, Maharaja Ramanuj Saran Singh Deo, C.B.E., succeeded to the Gaddi on the 31st December, 1917. He received the title of Maharaja as a hereditary distinction in 1918. In 1933 the title was conferred on him as a territorial distinction also. A large proportion of the area of the State is in the hands of estate-holders, of whom the chief are the estate-holders of the Lakhanpur, Jhilmilli, Dhourpur and Lundra Estates. They used formerly to control their own excise and police, which, however, were subsequently taken over by the State. The name of the Capital of the State has been changed from Bisrampur to Ambikapur. Sirguja is a secluded basin walled in on the north, east and south by massive hill barriers and protected from approach on the west by the forest-clad tract of Korea. Its most important physical features are the Mainpat, a magnificent table-land forming the southern boundary of the State, and the Jamirapat, a long winding ridge which is a part of its eastern boundary. From the Jamirapat isolated hill ranges, and the peculiar formations locally known as Pats, rise to an elevation of 3,500 and 4,000 feet, forming, on the north, the boundary of Palamau and blending on the south with the hill system of northern Jashpur. The chief rivers are the Kanhar, the Rer, and the Mahan, which flow northwards towards the Sone, and the Sankh which takes a southerly course to join the Brahmini. In the valley of the Kanhar river there is an abrupt descent of 900 feet from the table-land of the east to the fairly level country of Central Sirguja which here divides into two broad stretches of fertile and well-tilled land. One of these runs south towards Udaipur, and separates the Mainpat from the wild highland of Khuritha in Jashpur, the other trends to the west, and, opening out as it goes, forms the main area of cultivated land in the State. There is ample archological evidence of the State having been at one time occupied by a race far more civilised than its present inhabitants. Among the chief objects of interest one that deserves prominent mention is the Ramgarh hill with remains of a mighty fortress, magnifi- cent temples and superb images. It consists of a long steep ridge rising over a thousand feet from the plains. At its northern end there is a vast tunnel known as Hathpur and above this tunnel are two imposing caves known respectively as Sita Baingra and Lakhsman Baingra. The cave of Sita Baingra closely resembles the rock dwellings of the old Buddhist priests to be found at Khandagiri in the Puri District of Orissa. There is on this ridge a small level ledge of rock at the southern extremity of which a stream of crystal clear and icy cold water gushes forth, flowing over a broad seam of coal. It is supplied from a huge cavern of water situated in the heart of the lofty mass of rock towering above. On this ledge a mela is annually held in Chait when pilgrims from all parts come to drink the water of this spring. On the way to this ledge is an old gateway built of great masses of stone cut and carved in beautiful scroll work. It is difficult to understand how human hands could have erected these enormous blocks of stone on the sheer face of the rock. Not the least noteworthy of archeological treasures on the Ramgarh hill are remains of gorgeous temples; images of Ramchandra, Sita, Lakhsman and Hanuman; Ravan Durbar with images of Ravan and Kumbhakaran ; and the Vashista Gupha where the spiritual adviser of Ramchandra is supposed to have lived. The population of the State has increased to over five lakhs against two lakhs in the eighties. The majority of the inhabitants are Dravidian aborigines, the most numerous castes being Gonds, Gwallas, Kawars, Oraons, Rajwars, Korwas, Khairwars, Cherwas, Ghasias, Mundas, Nagasias and Santhals. The aborigines are generally simple, quiet and uncomplaining people. But the Korwas and Kodakus are liable to outbreaks of crime. They in the past used occasionally to attack traders for salt or cloth and liquor shops for drink. Successful measures have since been taken for reclaiming and settling them. The material condition of the people varies greatly. 212 The jungle tribes are extremely poorly off, but the people of the plains, which constitute a very large portion of the State, are, comparatively speaking, well off. The large tracts of country comprised in the Rampur, Bisrampur, Ladwa, Lundra, Partappur, Shrinagar and Jhilmili tappas yield abundant crops of paddy and fair crops of wheat, gram and barley. In normal years these tappas are literally infested with traders who come to purchase grain and export it to the railway. The people are decently clad, mostly in thick home-spun cotton garments, while some have quilted raiment. Their wants are of the simplest kind. The physique of the people is good. Skin diseases are common, but otherwise they appear healthy and strong and not much affected by fever. Their chief luxury is tobacco which they generally grow in their own court- yards. Gur is also one of the chief imports of the State. Rice is the staple food of the ordinary cultivators and labourers, but all are fond of mahua flower, and eat it when available in large quantities in preference to rice. Yams (kanda) and arrowroot are also largely consumed. The villagers are not, as a rule, indebted to money-lenders, but the debts incurred are among themselves. All over the most fertile and best developed portion of the State rice is the principal crop. Wheat, barley and gram are the chief spring crops. Of the oil seeds, til, jatangi, linseed and mustard are commonly grown. The only important manufacture is coarse cloth for general use made locally by the weaving caste known as Pankas. The chief articles of import are wheat, gram, salt, tobacco, metal utensils, spices and cloths, while exports consist chiefly of arhars, potatoes and minor forest produce. There is occurrence of coal, iron, gold, ochre, marble and lime in the State, but none of these things except coal seems likely, according to expert opinion, to be imported from an economic point of view. Prospecting in regard to coal may be taken in hand before long. The early history of Sirguja is rather obscure. According to tradition it was originally split up into a number of tracts inhabited by Dravidian tribes, each under its own Chief, who lived in an extremely primitive fashion and were given to internecine wars with one another. Some seventeen hundred years ago a Raksel Chandrabansi Rajput prince from Kundri in the district of Palamau invaded their territorries and reduced most of them to subjection. The actual founder of the present State of Sirguja was Raja Bishnu Pratap Singh of Bhojputkar, who, de- feating the last surviving Dravidian Chief, Sri Samni Singh, in Samvat 251, built a fort at Ram- garh and ruled for thirty-five years. The present Ruler is 114th in descent from Raja Bishnu Pratap Singh. At one time the Sirguja Chief was apparently the overlord not only of the territory known as the Sirguja State but also the present States of Udaipur, Jashpur, Korea and Chang Bhakhar. Udaipur was an appendage of a younger branch of the reigning family of Sirguja, until it escheated to the British Government and was conferred on a younger brother of the Chief of Sirguja in 1860 as independent charge. In 1758 a Maratha army overran the State and compelled the Chief to acknowledge himself a tributary of the Berar Government. In 1818 the State was ceded to the British Government under a provisional agreement concluded with Madhoji Bhonsla, and owing to some internal troubles Captain H. Sinnock was appointed Superintendent of the affairs of Sirguja. When order was restored Lal Amar Singh, great-grandfather of the present Ruler, was declared Raja and in 1826 was invested with the title of Maharaja. He was the first recognised Feudatory Chief of the Sirguja State. He received a Sanad by which a tribute of Rs. 3,001 was settled to be paid to the British Government. 215 The most conspicuous figure in the history of the Ruling family of Sirguja was Maharaja Raghunath Saran Singh Deo, father of the present Chief. He succeeded to the Gadi in 1879 as a minor on the death of his father, Maharaja Inderjit Singh, and was invested with full powers in 1882. In I887 he was awarded the title of Maharaja and in 1896 that of Maharaja Bahadur as a personal distinction. He was exceedingly liberal and kind-hearted as well as rigorously dutiful. He was also a great hunter and sportsman, having shot in his lifetime nearly a hundred tigers. When he came to the throne, the State was in an extremely primitive condition and was void of Courts, schools, and such other institutions. He, however, established about ten Courts including those of Tahsildars with Civil and Criminal powers, twenty-five Primary schools, a high school called the Edward High School at the Headquarters, three dispensaries, seventeen branch post offices, and a combined post and telegraph office at the Capital. Excise Adminis- tration was put on a sound footing in his time. He converted his original residential house into a grand palace fitted up with electric light and fans. He also constructed some good roads in the State, an excellent guest house in the Capital and a State shop containing articles of daily use for the benefit of the people and State officials. During the Great War he contributed over two lakhs and a half of rupees to different War funds. He gave a very liberal education to his only son, the present Ruler, and trained him for State affairs by giving him special powers in the different branches of State administration. He died in 1917, deeply mourned by his subjects. The present Ruler, Maharaja Ramanuj Saran Singh Deo, C.B.E., was born on the 4th November, 1895, and succeeded to the Gadi on the 31st December, 1917. At the installation cere- mony on the 18th April, 1918, the Political Agent presented him a Khalita and a jewelled sword and announced the bestowal on him of the hereditary title of Maharaja. In honour of this great occasion the Maharaja presented Rs. 30,000 to Government for use towards the War. Subsequently he subscribed a large amount to the War loans. He is, like his father, exceedingly liberal, kind- hearted, with courtly and dignified bearing, but of studious habits and reflective disposition. In conversation he is deferential and sparing of pressing his own views. He is of regular and simple habits. He has great sympathy for the poor and is of a forgiving nature. In domestic matters he adheres to the orthodox principles, and carefully observes the routine religious customs. He is a good rider and polo-player. Above all he is a very keen Shikari. He has already shot over eight hundred tigers in addition to many other wild animals. He is very charitably disposed. His munificence includes Rs. 15,000 for a building at Jubbulpore for the Young Men's Christian Association and Rs. 53,000 for an electric installation at Rajkumar College, Raipur. The Maharaja personally attends to all the State work, and regularly receives petitions. He has full Criminal powers, and himself takes up Sessions and other important Criminal cases. When on tour, he carefully enquires into the state of the people and about the treatment they receive at the hands of subordinate State officials. He has effected many reforms and improvements in the State, having also constructed motor roads all over his territory. He has also constructed a well-equipped hospital, a females' hospital and a splendid High Court building at a great cost. The Maharaja Sahib visited England and the Continent of Europe once and visited East Africa three times for Shikar purpeses. After the death of the first Maharani Sahiba he married in 1922 a niece of the present Maharaja of Nepal. The Heir-apparent, Kumar Ambikeshwar Saran Singh Deo, was born in 1910 and was married to a sister of the Raja Sahib of Bansi. After her death he has been married to a daughter The of His Highness the Raja Sahib of Sitamau, Central India.

The State of Talcher was established at the end of the 12th century A.D. by Raja Narahary Singh Deo, a scion of the Rana Thakur family of Jaipur. The Rajas of Talcher never submitted to the sovereignty of the Raja of Khurda or Puri. Though the Maharattas were occasionally successful in exacting tribute, the State of Talcher maintained its independence and never accepted the claim of Paramountcy of the Raja of Nagpur. The British authorities recognised this independent position of Talcher and entered into treaty relations with Raja Bhagirathy Birabar Harichandan (great-grandfather of the present Ruler) in 1803, prior to the Deagaon Treaty of 1804. Raja Dayanidhi Birabar Harichandan (grandfather of the present Ruler) helped the British Government with his own troops in quelling the Angul rebellion and was rewarded with the title of Mahendra Bahadur, a Khillat and an elephant, along with the privilege of being addressed as Meherban Dostan.

Expenditure on education has increased from Rs. 1,775 in 1900-01 to Rs. 18,344 in 1934-35 and that on sanitation from Rs 857 to Rs. 8,517. Wages for labour, both skilled and unskilled, have risen there to six times. The mileage of roads is 421 miles against 29 miles in 1900-01 and there are already 87 miles of telephone line. After a very careful and close scrutiny, the Durbar has got codified since 1915, for the guidance well- of the Durbar and the subjects alike, all laws and regulations of the State, and has established a organised and graded system of judicature starting from Village Panchayats upwards.

(iv) ""I am glad to see that civil and revenue cases are also promptly tried; the work here, in fact, is better by a good deal than in some British districts which I have known. A very interesting feature is the Priest's Court for the settlement of social disputes, some of which are very troublesome. I cannot refrain from saying that I have seldom seen a more kindly and benevolent face than that of the presiding priest, and I feel sure that he takes infinite pains to do justice His (the Chief's) relations with his people are excellent; it is a pleasure to see old village head- men and small children come forward eagerly to speak to him; he is welcomed whereover he goes.

These are all at headquarters, but in the muffasil cultivation is extending rapidly and is greatly assisted by the irrigation projects which the Chief has carried -Note, dated 10th January, 1916.

The Jubaraj Sahib and the Pattayet Sahib have proved their competence in administration work and the departments in their respective charge are very well run indeed I saw a number of irrigation bunds constructed and under construction.

There are at the present time living in Talcher a number of hardened ex-criminals who have abandoned crime and ceased to prey on their fellowmen. I was particularly impressed by the relations between the Ruling Chief and these men and his skill in handling them. No one who visits Talcher can fail to be impressed with his activity and the intimate control which he maintains over all departments of the administration of his State -Note, dated 17th May, 1931.

We are all happy on this auspicious occasion and that he be spared long to rule over his vast Empire and possessions and like his beloved grandmother, pray Victoria may the Good, we may in fullness of time celebrate his Golden Jubilee (50 years' rule) and Diamond Jubilee (60 years' rule).

But Nityananda Tung was of a very chivalrous spirit and attract- ed the notice of the then King of Orissa by dint of personal valour.
